              "'\"Titanic\" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn\\'t already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.\\n\\nI give the film a 9 because it isn\\'t perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there\\'s no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn\\'t exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron\\'s other huge success, \"Avatar\". Well worth seeing once. I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don\\'t think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he\\'s in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox. Who says that old fashioned romantic films don\\'t sell. They certainly do if they\\'re done right as the story in Titanic certainly is.\\n\\nThis blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to Maytime. In fact in casting Gloria Stuart as old Rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold, Director James Cameron went back to a contemporary of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.\\n\\nThe film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in the middle Eighties which did cause great excitement at the time. Searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated April 14, 1912. The woman is still alive and its Gloria Stuart who tells her tale the way an aged Jeanette MacDonald did in Maytime.\\n\\nWinning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of Titanic, itinerant artist Leonardo DiCaprio gets on board the vessel. He meets and woos a younger version of Gloria Stuart who is played by Kate Winslet. Unfortunately she\\'s about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother, Frances Fisher, who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse.\\n\\nHer prospective fiancÃ© is Billy Zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotum/bodyguard in David Warner who has one of the best roles in the film. Still Leo and Kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikes.\\n\\nOne thing that James Cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the Titanic story to overwhelm his romantic leads. In fact they are an integral part of the story as young Leo reaches for what was unobtainable.\\n\\nLeonardo DiCaprio remarked that his part of Jack was the least complex role he ever did. The part is a romantic lead, the guy has no secrets or hidden issues, he\\'s just a young man in love. Maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for Best Actor in the face of all those nominations Titanic did get. It won for Best Picture and Best Director and a flock of Oscars in the technical area. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were nominated and lost for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.\\n\\nTitanic is a story that\\'s been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself. The Germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which Nazi inspired though it was, did make a few points against the British upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned. There was a fine version in 1953 with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship. And the British did the classic, A Night to Remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ship\\'s officers point of view.\\n\\nStill they\\'ll have to go some beat this one. Titanic is a film for lovers of all ages and run Maytime back to back with Titanic if you can get DVDs and/or VHSs of both films. Titanic (1997)\\n\\n**** (out of 4)\\n\\nJames Cameron\\'s Oscar-winning love story about star crossed lovers (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet) who come from different back grounds but fall in love aboard the Titanic. I remember seeing this on its opening weekend and it\\'s amazing to see how well the film holds up after all these years. Yes, since it became so popular there are always going to be those who hold that against the film and while it\\'s far from a masterpiece I do think it holds up quite nicely against many of the classic epics that have been made since D.W. Griffith\\'s THE BIRTH OF A NATION. That film, GONE WITH THE WIND, BEN HUR and other epics were all grand on scale, told big stories with big effects and each of them had flaws here and there.\\n\\nThe most amazing thing about TITANIC is the way Cameron is able to tell the fake story and mix it in with so many real-life people and events. Since 1997 I\\'ve watched countless documentaries on the real subject and watching the film on its re-release made me appreciate it so much more. The little details given about certain real-life people was a major plus and so were the smaller touches. The amount of love and detail that Cameron puts into every single shot of the movie makes it very poetic and at any time you can\\'t help but just look around and try to take in everything in the frame. Very few films have gone all-in with their subject matters but this here goes for everything and just comes up short at a few times. It certainly helps that you have two strong leads turning in fine performance.\\n\\nWinslet was clearly the best of the bunch as she brings so much life to her character and perfectly manages to fit every side of her. Be it the rich, spoiled girl, the confused one, the heroic side or the love story aspect. I was less than thrilled with DiCaprio when I first saw the movie but looking back on the movie he too really stands out and delivers. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart also deliver.\\n\\nI think the biggest flaws in the film can be had in the screenplay. Many people objected to having the fake characters so close to the real ones during the finale but this here didn\\'t bother me too much as when we see the real people it\\'s in situations based on what we\\'re led to believe happened. What bothered me in 1997 and today is that Cameron decided to make Zane the main villain over the iceberg. I really think the story starts of go overboard during the third act as Leo gets chained up and then we have more drama wrapped around the real event. There\\'s no question that the romance made this movie such a hit but I think it could have worked with everyone had the stuff with Zane been toned down. God knows there was enough drama with the sinking to make up for Zane running around with a gun. With that said, that\\'s about the only problem with TITANIC and those things aren\\'t disastrous enough to ruin the movie. There\\'s no question that the romance works, the special effects are terrific and on the whole this is just a movie that works on every level. You know, I love disaster movies, and you don\\'t get much bigger a disaster flick than TITANIC, James Cameron\\'s magnum opus, a massively-budgeted and massively award-winning 1997 film that swept the board at the Oscars and has gone down in history as one of the most popular films ever made. Yet I only enjoyed half of it, and that\\'s due to a problematic structure that sacrifices disaster in favour of a cheesy, sappy romance story.\\n\\nCameron has always been king when it comes to technology and people interacting with it: from his early sci-fi movies to THE ABYSS and AVATAR, he\\'s great at depicting a world where people interact with technology and use it to their advantage. When he focuses on the disaster and sinking of the ship, this is an excellent film with some very impressive special effects that really get across the scale of the disaster.\\n\\nWhen it comes to human characters, Cameron is a much less assured writer. The romance that plays out here is more unrealistic than in a cheap paperback novel and just as twee. The characters are one-dimensional, from DiCaprio\\'s irritating commoner to Winslet\\'s utterly unbelievable aristocrat who falls in love with him. Their romantic scenes are cringeworthy and as with the other characters they act in very modern days that would have been alien to the era. The less said about the likes of Billy Zane\\'s cardboard cut-out villain the better.\\n\\nIn the end, we get a film which spends the entire first hour and a half just plodding around with dumb characters before the disaster strikes, and then things pick up, although there are still lots of cheesy moments and poor dialogue. It\\'s 2/3 romance and 1/3 disaster, and while the disaster stuff is great, the romance is execrable. A NIGHT TO REMEMBER remains the best retelling of the tragedy out there because it focused on the events of the tragedy; I feel Cameron\\'s TITANIC does a disservice to those who lost their lives that night. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is searching for a legendary gem called The Heart of the Ocean presumed lost on the Titanic. When he finds a drawing instead, Rose (Gloria Stuart/Kate Winslet) comes on board and tells her story of Titanic and her love Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). She\\'s a wealthy girl destined for a loveless marriage to the hateful Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). He\\'s a wandering artist who won his Titanic ticket in a poker game. He would save her in every way that a person can be saved.\\n\\nI have often railed against the insertion of a love story unnecessarily into a historical event like \\'Pearl Harbor\\'. But I think James Cameron made the right decision here. The story is compelling by itself. Leo has that boyish charm. Kate and Leo has become a legendary Hollywood big screen pairing. This time it works because it\\'s well written, and well acted.\\n\\nThere is the great CGI. It\\'s relatively seamless, and ahead of its times. The engine room is magnificent, even better than the boat itself. The iceberg hit was very convincing.\\n\\nThen there is the sinking. For something that is absolutely expected, it still shocks. The suspense of it all holds my attention every time. The last hour of the movie is perhaps one of the most tension filled sequence of all times. It is the incredible CGI as well as the amazing stunts. It marries the real world with the computer world, and have rarely been exceeded even to this day. It is more harrowing than all those 3D superheroes smashing into skyscrapers. For it\\'s iconic status, I have to give this 9/10. It\\'s hard to believe that nearly nine years have passed since this movie came out. It\\'s a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling, even if the romance schmaltzes it up a bit. I\\'m not too critical about films that stretch the truth. If that were not the case, we would only watch documentaries, and, of course, many of those are suspect. In addition to the incredible recreation of the Titanic and the people who sailed her, there is an air of mystery maintained throughout, accentuated by the incredible music score. The fact that we all know the story and the result makes us voyeurs to history. I enjoyed this movie, and yet it made me sad. I sat next to a couple of twenty something types with their baseball caps on backwards, yelling \"all right\" when a falling body would smack against an obstruction as it plummeted down the length of the capsizing ship. I sat in awe of the power of nature and imagined those poor people dying from the stupidity of an overconfident shipbuilder and captain. I know it\\'s just a movie, but it had a really connection to my heart. The business with Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet didn\\'t really grab me. What did was that there was a hopelessness beyond anything we can fathom. If you read my review of \"A Night to Remember,\" also a fine film from much earlier, you will see that it\\'s about people saying goodbye to their wives and children and to another day that makes this event so horrible. It\\'s quite a marvelous movie. We may have forgotten that in the wake of all the attention it received, including parodies and spoofs. I do not like Titanic. too much ambition, too many applauds. but it has the rare gift to use romanticism to remind a story who becomes , grace of Cameron, mythical. it has, in same measure, the virtue to use Gloria Stuart in a beautiful, touching role. and to impose to public Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, both great actors. story of an impossible love story , in fact it is only the story of force of memories and the confrontation with the past\\'s ghosts. it is story of a gem and story of a slice of happiness. and it is not fair to ignore the great care for details, the hard work of entire team, the craziness of Cameron to recreate a lost picture. but the ambition has always unfinished products. Titanic is a beautiful film. but not more. a blockbuster useful for tears and for a high position in statistics. but , maybe, it is enough because, I admit, I am deep subjective, Titanic has not the sparkle who transforms beautiful films in great films. nan Rose DeWitt Bukater is a beautiful young woman, travelling to America to be married to the dashing cad that is Caledon Hockley. Jack Dawson is a poor Irish kid with little hope of getting to the land of plenty Â\\x96 until, that is, he wins tickets onto a ship making that very crossing in mere minutes. Jack and his friend rush onto the boat and find themselves in 3rd class with all the rest of the poor people. Meanwhile, on the upper decks, the rich enjoy the space and pleasure that comes with privilege but yet Rose feels little happiness about her loveless prospects. A chance meeting between Jack and Rose sees them fall into a passionate instant love affair but time will show them that the class divide between them is really the least of their concerns.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, Titanic seems to have enjoyed great praise and great abuse. When it came out it was the biggest movie of the day, sitting at the top of the charts for months and also sweeping the Best Picture Academy Award for that year. However as time has gone on it has received more and more of a kicking from viewers and it has now lost a lot of the appeal and shine that it once had. To some this is just a simple backlash without basis but I\\'m not sure I agreed with that. Of course there is an element of wanting to tear down the \"success\" of the film and perhaps wipe that smug smile off James \"king of the world\" Cameron\\'s face but for me a lot of the negativity comes from people seeing the film in the cold light of day, without the crowded cinema, without the hype, without the partner to hug up to while watching.\\n\\nSo it is with me here. The first time I watched it I was with my partner in the front room of a packed cinema and allowed myself to be carried along by the sheer spectacle and not worry too much about the finer points. However watching it again I viewed it like I would any other film. As such the failings came tumbling out. The story is consistently weak whether it is the speed and superficiality of the central \"relationship\" or the roundly average dialogue within the script. Funny how a rush to sex is seen as romantic when it occurs in the movie whereas if the same tale was set in a Bolton nightclub, the view would not be the same! Part of the reason for this is the forced emotion and atmosphere of the film, with James Horner\\'s manipulative score constantly on hand to tell us \"you\\'re meant to cry at this bit\". This is very different from bringing the audience into the characters and the story in a genuine way and you are not getting into this car because you want to so much as being forced in with a hood over your head.\\n\\nOf course this is not so different from many Hollywood blockbuster, but it is particularly noticeable here because the script and characters are so lacking. Director Cameron cannot make up for the failings of writer Cameron and instead just injects as much of this manipulative schmaltz into proceedings as he can as he waits for his effects budget to kick in. When it eventually does there is no denying that it is impressive in terms of spectacle but I do wonder how this will hold up as the effects become ordinary, because there is little else for the viewer to feast on. Certainly the performances offer very little, mostly due to the material handed to them. DiCaprio is miscast. I know it has been said countless times before but he looks far too young for the part and, as he looks more adult in other films he looks younger and younger in retrospect. Both he and Winslet are capable of so much more but neither really work individually or as a couple. Zane hams it up as a \"baddie\" and actually seems to be having a good time of it unlike his co-stars. Bates, Fisher, Paxton, Warner, Amis, Hyde and others all fill round the edges with so-so performances.\\n\\nThere is no questioning that this was a massive success and will stand up in lists for years to come. However the effects are already dating and, them to one side, there isn\\'t a huge amount else to spend three hours on. The love story is clunky to match the dialogue and the actors can do little with it producing an unconvincing love story that is forced out with manipulative and exploitative methods that are exposed as such with a clear eyed viewing. A big film but not really a good one. nan A seventeen-year-old aristocrat (Kate Winslet), expecting to be married to a rich claimant (Billy Zane) by her mother, falls in love with a kind but poor artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.\\n\\nThe first thing that is really striking about this film is that it came from James Cameron, who is much better known for science fiction films like \"Terminator\", \"Avatar\" and \"Aliens\". He is not the first person that comes to mind when you think of historical fiction romances. And yet, he nailed it. \"Titanic\", despite its length of three hours, was a huge success and may have sold more VHS copies than any other movie.\\n\\nBut beyond the romance, this is actually a rather decent movie. I cannot say why, it is something hard to put one\\'s finger on. Most likely, it has something to do with Billy Zane, who is more or less the greatest thing about the film. Okay, everyone knows what happens in \"Titanic\", so I\\'ll discuss a few other points. While the movie was in the theaters, one of my friends went to see it 13 times, just so that he could find goofs; the one that he picked up on was when someone opens a door, turns his head, and you see that it\\'s the wrong color. When I took a sailing class in summer, 2005, the teacher explained why specifically the Titanic sank: it was traveling way too fast for something that size (so they couldn\\'t turn in time), and the metal on the ship\\'s sides was rather shoddy; that is to say, they endangered everyone\\'s lives so as to save money for themselves (well, that\\'s one of many times when those at the top have put profits ahead of safety). And I have a question: considering how many people died on the Titanic, was it appropriate to use this event to further Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s career? As for that story that I wrote, it portrayed Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck (from \"In & Out\") believing themselves to resemble Leo and Kate; Al Pacino (from \"Donnie Brasco) realizing that he was going to sleep with the fishes; Jim Carrey (from \"Liar Liar\") admitting: \"I can\\'t lie: I wasn\\'t watching for icebergs while I was steering!\"; Kim Basinger (from \"LA Confidential\") wondering whether or not she would look like Veronica Lake at the bottom of the ocean; and Jack Nicholson (from \"As Good as It Gets\") still inside his cabin and saying \"Don\\'t knock on my door! Even if the ship is sinking, don\\'t knock on my door!\".\\n\\nOh, I forgot to say my opinion of the movie. When everyone at school asked me what I thought, I always said \"Well, I...\" That\\'s what I\\'m going to say here. I consider \"Titanic\" right down the middle. I think that \"In & Out\" was the best movie of 1997. End of story. nan No sense going into great detail about this film, which just about everyone who watches movies saw when it came out. I still don\\'t recall a film getting as much \"hype\" as this one did. I doubt if the Second Coming would get the kind of publicity this movie received. It was disgusting - the PR, the story and the favorable box office response.\\n\\nOh, once the ocean-liner hits the icebergs and the disaster starts, it\\'s terrific but that\\'s not until the last 45 minutes of this 194-minute movie. Too bad we had to wade through all the baloney before this climactic scene.\\n\\nThe baloney, in a nutshell, was (1) a stupid teen romance between two arrogant, unlikeable people; (2) most the film being a lie, defaming many of the people who were heroes in that disaster, instead choosing to picture them as selfish villains.\\n\\nThe latter is all in the name of \\'political correctness,\\' some filmmakers like James Cameron, are filled with, something akin to horse manure.\\n\\nTo make it brief: in real life, the men in the First Class did everything they could to get the women and children safely off the boat. Just look it up! Relatives of those people were justifiably extremely upset over Cameron\\'s totally-fabricated story, and I can\\'t blame them.\\n\\nAnyway, even with all the untruths, if they had cut down on the Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet rebel-type attitude and romance, it would have been a far better film, but then again you wouldn\\'t have the billions of dollars in revenue from the 12-15-year-old girls who flocked by the millions to see this farce. The rest of us would have preferred to see the true story of the famous disaster. nan A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl\\'s fiancÃ©, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance).\\n\\nJames Cameron\\'s Titanic is what I call \\'factasy\\'. In other words, it\\'s a factual story combined with fantastical elements to make the finished article more entertaining to the masses. A more recent example of this melding of truth and fiction is The Aeronauts, but where that film played it too fast and loose with the facts and ultimately came crashing down to earth in tatters, Cameron gets the balance of real and imagined just right, making his film both a fascinating insight into one of the most famous disasters of the 20th century, and a thoroughly charming love story.\\n\\nA master storyteller, Cameron successfully steers his way around any potentially disastrous obstacles that threaten to bring the film to a standstill. Even though there\\'s a good hour and a half before any sight of an iceberg, Titanic is thoroughly engrossing from start to finish, a testament to its director\\'s skill at weaving a good yarn, and to the talent of his impressive cast (which includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy). Kate and Leo make for one of cinema\\'s most iconic pair of lovers, and exude a likability and charm that carries the first half of the film. The latter part is mostly about the special effects, something that Cameron excels at, always pushing the boundaries of technology. Even after 23 years, the sinking of the mighty ship is a sight to behold, and still sends chills up the spine.\\n\\nIt\\'s only the film\\'s closing moments that prevent me from giving the film full marks: why oh why did Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) chuck her priceless necklace into the sea? Give it to your granddaughter, donate it to an orphanage, put it in a museum, let Bill Paxton have it, but please don\\'t throw it overboard! And as if that crazy act wasn\\'t reprehensible enough, when the old dear carks it, her spirit returns to the Titanic to be reunited with Jack -- excuse me Rose, but what about your dead husband and father to your child?\\n\\n9/10. I half-expected an overwrought concoction of incredible high drama, but James Cameron\\'s fictionalized film of a real incident from 1912 is nearly free of derivative devices or sappy puppy love issues. Before the infamous ocean liner perishes in the icy Atlantic Ocean, two passengers--third-class gadabout Leonardo DiCaprio and conflicted first-class passenger Kate Winslet--fall in love in what is a very captivating romantic interlude. Cannily-made picture is, of course, full of marvelous effects, but its this key romance that most people will end up remembering (and with good reason, as the performers are terrific). Cameron\\'s pacing is both giddy and tight, and he draws vivid characterizations from the supporting players as well. High entertainment. ***1/2 from **** This is a May 2020 update, as I have watched this maybe 5 or 6 times over the years, most recently last night. Yes, it is long, and they probably spend too much time showing the carnage during the actual sinking, but after I start watching it and become immersed yet again the time figuratively flies.\\n\\nFor a movie that was made almost 25 years ago it holds up extremely well in picture and sound. Dicaprio and Winslet are of course marvelous in their roles but for me Billy Zane is the best here, the way he plays the demanding rich American taking his British teenage fiancee back home, only to be interrupted by the carefree Jack who presents a completely different outlook on life.\\n\\nSay what you want about James Cameron, the person, but he did a masterful job of weaving together several different stories, including the elderly modern day Rose telling her story after Jack\\'s charcoal drawing is recovered from the wreckage 2 1/2 miles under the surface of the Atlantic. Even just the modern day images of the real Titanic wreckage add immeasurably to the impact of the whole movie.\\n\\nThis will remain a classic for many decades to come, well deserving of its various awards. One of the monuments of the cinema which won 11 Oscars in Hollywood in 1998, a huge success (well deserved) all over the world. The revelation of two actors until then virtually unknown. This is James Cameron\\' masterpiece. He chose to relate the tragedy of the Titanic that took place on the 12th of April 1912, through the intermediary of a love story lived between a wealthy and pretty young woman (Kate Winslet) and a modest painter (LÃ©onardo Dicaprio). Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie. The love between \"Jack\" and \"Rose\" is so strong that can hardly believe the Titanic will bump into an iceberg and will sink. It\\'s also together with a model bravery that the two lovers will try to escape the ship\\'s sinking (although historically accurate).\\n\\nLÃ©onardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet will stay among the famous mythical couples in the cinema\\'s history. It\\'s obvious that they are between the hands of a conscientious and carefully organized film-maker. James Cameron doesn\\'t leave anything high and dry. He adopted a sustained rhythm not spoiled by the enormous means that he\\'s got. It\\'s useless to say that he masters them perfectly thanks to an important budget. Not only has this budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the ship but it has also enabled a reconstruction from the traditional life in 1912 with its contrasts, its oppositions. Moreover, the movie enjoys an outstanding performance from all the actors, even the minor ones and several sequences and dialogs don\\'t lack humor.\\n\\nBut \"Titanic\" is also a limited place where takes place the confrontation of two different worlds: the proletarians and the middle-class persons. This confrontation is particularly well described during the ship\\'s sinking: the rich are by the lifeboats whereas the poor are still inside the ship and they\\'re forbidden to go outside.\\n\\nThe second part of the movie is remarkably well filmed and follows a logical advance based on the increase of fear and distress. Cameron emphasizes particularly on the madness that spread to the passengers but also on the officers. Little by little, these last ones are becoming mad (one of them will kill unwittingly one of the passengers who was trying to get into a lifeboat). Besides, a few touches make the movie surrealist (the four musicians keep on playing while the ship\\'s sinking)\\n\\nThe other obvious qualities: a gorgeous music, some smart costumes. At the end, a movie that creates a deep emotion and where everything contributes to a perfect success. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed \"Titanic\" in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James Cameron. The film also stars Billy Zane, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, and Victor Garber.\\n\\nRather than go into the story, I\\'ll just say that this film is a true masterpiece, meticulously researched, designed, costumed, and acted, and gives one the feeling of the desperation, fear, sorrow, and finality that the people on the ship must have felt. The entire time I watched it, I kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the World Trade Center on 9/11.\\n\\nThere have been several films about the Titanic but none so lovingly recreated and so powerful emotionally. Kate Winslet is exquisite as Rose, the upper class young woman engaged to a brute (Zane), who falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). DiCaprio is terrific - exuberant, passionate, and adventurous.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know a lot about the Titanic, this movie will pique your interest. When you read more about it, you\\'ll be impressed by Cameron\\'s commitment to bring this piece of history to life. James Francis Cameron\\'s Titanic is a well done film, but I think it gets more credit than it deserves. True, the film won eleven Academy awards (including 3 for Cameron and 2 for composer James Horner), but I think it shouldn\\'t had been ranked so high- like with Ben-Hur status.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know the story of Titanic now, your probably one of the ones who didn\\'t survive because the story is world-renoun. So are it\\'s actors (Leonardo DiCaprio is not at his best, Kate Winslet is at least hot, and Billy Zane works as a villain) who work into Jim Cameron\\'s script about romance on the high seas. Luckily, the film doesn\\'t go as slow as you may think, but still, that\\'s no excuse to have the Titanic sinking in the movie longer than it did in real life.\\n\\nBut seriously, this film does have many great qualitites. The story is well lay out, and the special effects are dazzling (it actually looks like the Titanic is sinking) which also won a Oscar. One of the great points in this film is the score by James Horner which is his best and one of the best ever, but that is over-shadowed by fancy fireworks and bad acting. Good direction though. B Well, 15 years after first seeing this at a second run-dollar theatre that I worked at when I was living in Jacksonville, FL, I finally decided to watch Titanic again in 3-D at the place my movie cinema-working friend is now employed at. Once again, we experienced the romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the latter wants to escape the more controlling Billy Zane. Despite the dialogue between them verging on the melodramatic, director James Cameron also thought up some truly witty lines that especially suited Kathy Bates as the Unsinkable Molly Brown. And, yes, it\\'s still very touching seeing Jack and Rose willing to stay together during all that chaos as the title ship keeps sinking. And how cool is it seeing Golden Age veteran Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting how it was during Titanic\\'s only voyage. And not to mention James Horner\\'s iconic score. And while I thought Celine Dion\\'s Oscar-winning song \"My Heart Will Go On\" was overplayed on Top 40 radio stations then, I actually enjoyed hearing it again during the end credits (though we only stayed through the cast list). And of course, Cameron keeps things exciting enough during the climatic sinking though sometimes I thought he piled it a bit much when he showed a young boy crying just standing there as Jack and Rose were running (it felt a little more contrived than usual though I realized such a scene could have really taken place). In summation, James Cameron\\'s Titanic is still a very entertaining picture worthy of its Oscar status enhanced a bit by the 3-D experience though it wasn\\'t really necessary IMHO. An excellent version of the 1953 original as well as the 1956 \"A Night to Remember.\"\\n\\nWe really have character development in this fine picture. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet shine as our doomed hero and heroine.\\n\\nIn a comeback performance, Gloria Stuart does very well in the part of Winslet as an old woman.\\n\\nWhat is so enjoyable about this film is the sociological depiction of the upper and lower classes. We can see from almost the beginning of the disaster, the lower class will be doomed to tragedy.\\n\\nFrances Fisher gives excellent support as Kate\\'s upper class mean mother. This is a mother so mean that Kate went through life never revealing to her that she had survived.\\n\\nDi Caprio, it has been argued, looked too young for the part. He really seemed to mature as the film went on. His scene before his demise was well done and memorable. nan nan nan It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It\\'s like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn\\'t matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.\\n\\nYou jump - I jump.\\n\\nTitanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it\\'s true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack\\'s story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.\\n\\nNever let go.\\n\\nSo may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society\\'s class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It\\'s what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10 TITANIC is actually two films. The first film is a very unlikely love story so syrupy it can cause diabetes. Then it suddenly mutates into a James Bond film where - wait for this - Bond is played by Kate Winslet. Maybe this isn\\'t entirely accurate because James is total fantasy , but never becomes as unbelievable as this. Oh and at least in a Bond film the Brits are the good guys unlike here where they are invaribly cruel , stupid and/or cowardly. Also at no point in a Bond film does a script change the laws of physics where it\\'s possible for someone to escape from the undercurrants of a ship weighing thousands of tons. Oh and the special effects are better in Bond films , TITANIC\\'s are not entirely convincing.\\n\\nBut the most fantastic thing about TITANIC isn\\'t the fact it made so much money at the box office ( This is explained by 14 year old girls lining up at the cinema to watch Leonardo for the 25th time ) but the fact this film won 11 ( Yes Eleven.You read that right ) Oscars, equalling the total held by BEN HUR. What the hell were the Academy thinking ? I know they didn\\'t give any awards for the quality of the acting or even nominated the screenplay for an Oscar ( They got that right . Boy did they get that right ) but for it to win 11 Oscars including Best Picture ( Didn\\'t any of the voters watch LA CONFIDENTIAL ? ) really upset me because films like GONE WITH THE WIND , etc didn\\'t get that many I\\'ve looked back through the other comments posted here and can\\'t believe I saw the same film some of these disgruntled \"critics\" are talking about. What\\'s so wrong about telling a love story against the background of a real-life historical event?\\n\\nSince when is there a restriction on poetic license? Get real. \\'Titanic\\' is an extremely impressive movie from every standpoint in recreating an actual ship disaster that took more than a thousand lives. Told in a flashback technique, it focuses mainly on Jack and Rose and their unlikely meeting when she attempts suicide--but also draws in a number of other characters that are equally well integrated into the plot. The class distinction that existed then (and now) is shown with clarity--making complaints from previous \"commentators\" meaningless when they say that the film doesn\\'t even deal with this factor. The snobbery was there and is most fully exposed in the depiction of Rose\\'s class-conscious mother.\\n\\nTITANIC will go down as one of the greatest recreations of an actual event ever attempted on screen--masterful in all departments. The performances, from leads to bit players, are uniformly excellent--but no one has given enough credit to Billy Zane. He\\'s the perfect villain and plays his juicy role with incredible skill and zest. All those protesting that this film is a disaster are simply mouthing hollow words, all sound and fury signifying nothing. If it\\'s cool to knock this movie, so be it. But their appraisal of it is far from the truth and they are quite clearly in denial.\\n\\nThe Jack/Rose love affair is the weakest development in the script but at least it does point up the class distinction that played a large part in this human tragedy. \"there are only lifeboats for half the people... yea the better half\".\\n\\nThe segregation, oppression, and unenlightened separation of the privileged few from the unkempt, unwashed masses is the \"dramatic\" thread that seems to be the \"soul\" of this bloated, overwritten, orally deficient melodrama. It is completely counterpointed by the very last scene. An antithesis of the socially conscious concern of the film makers.\\n\\nIt is morally reprehensible, irresponsible, incomprehensible, and downright selfish. One wonders how many underprivileged children with empty bellies and deplorable living conditions could have been saved by that mega-million dollar necklace. All for a cheap sentimental tug.\\n\\nSome interesting special effects, attractive people, and unintentional humor are not enough to redeem this unforgivable, utter failure of a film that can only be subjugated to the lower decks of American Cinema. A typical James Cameron movie, i.e. all style, no substance, and excruciatingly long.\\n\\nPlot is basic - love story set against the Titanic tragedy, that\\'s it. Just basically drifts for 3.25 hours around that central plot. The direction is all about the amazing special effects, another Cameron trademark.\\n\\nOn the plus side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent in the lead roles, and their interaction is spot-on. This movie pretty much launched their careers (well, in DiCaprio\\'s case, shifted it up several notches). I saw the movie for the first time when it arrived on video, needless to say that I had very high expectations for this movie because I heard a lot about it. I watched the movie and I remembered my first reaction when I finished watching it, my reaction was: \"This is it?\" Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s not a bad movie, not at all. But I was disappointed about it all and it just didn\\'t met my expectations.\\n\\nEverybody knows the true story about the ship the \"Titanic\" and there are many movies/series made about it already. New about this movie is the love story. It\\'s always dangerous to put a love story in a movie because if the love story doesn\\'t work the movie doesn\\'t work. The love story does work for most parts in this movie, except for some scene\\'s in which I just don\\'t buy it.\\n\\nAlthough the movie is very long it doesn\\'t really ever get boring, which is of course a good thing. The best part of the movie is the sinking and you can see that James Cameron is really one of the best Action directors in the business.\\n\\nThe acting isn\\'t great but not bad either. The special effects look good with the exception of a few needless scene\\'s. The movie is also full of visual mistakes (for instance you can clearly see the camera in a scene, which is a HUGE mistake that I noticed on my first viewing) and the characters in my opinion aren\\'t really interesting enough.\\n\\nAlthough the movie got more credit then it really deserved I can still recommend this movie to everybody. Good but not perfect...\\n\\n7/10\\n\\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ There\\'s no doubting that the titanic is an epic movie for the ages. Beautiful cinematography and acting, such chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. The costuming and set design are beyond comparison, creating stunning visuals and bringing the story to life. The gravity of the disaster is conveyed beautifully and never ceases to make me weep endlessly. My only faults are that Jack could have definitely fit on that door, and old rose was dead wrong for tossing that necklace in the ocean. Yes, for a long time, I did avoid this one. Eventually, I realized that I had to; Cameron is talented enough to make this work. I\\'ve now seen every film he\\'s directed, save for Piranha Part II(which I understand was taken away from him), and the man always does a nice job. No, not every single picture of his is excellent... but they\\'re all worth the time(and with hardly any exceptions(and this certainly isn\\'t one), the investment of emotions from the audience, as well), they entertain and he\\'s yet to make the exact same thing twice(Terminator 2 is different from the original in notable areas, such as the tone). I don\\'t blindly love all of them; I maintain that the quality of The Abyss lies mainly in the gorgeous under-water photography. He never phones it in, and he always has something to say, somewhere to go with what he does. I was apprehensive of the idea that this would focus on a small group of people(in particular, the two leads), when this was indeed something that actually did happen, and many were killed. However, when you think about it, it needed to be like that; that\\'s what makes the incident(in this) have the devastating impact that I think we can all admit it does. Yes, the FX are amazing, and the production values offer a new definition of the term \"grandiose\" when applied to that aspect; the reason we \"feel\" it, though, is that we care about the ones we \"know\" to be on the ship. The characters are well-written, thoroughly developed, credible and all have something to do. Rose is a rather strong woman, and without it reaching anachronistic levels, either. She is not \"just a wife\", and she is fleshed out, something that many attempts at female role models neglect to do. The cast is spot-on, everyone is well-chosen. Every single acting performance is flawless. Arguably, this is somewhat black and white in its presentation of them; with that said, they are all convincing and have genuine personality. This is one of the greatest disaster movies, and epic love dramas, in the world of cinema. It is Hollywood and mainstream at its absolute best. Will it please everyone? Perhaps not, and probably not those who refuse to take it on its own terms. It was always clear what approach this took. And also, about hype... ignore it. Yes, you read that right. In this case and in all others, pretend like you can\\'t hear what everyone is making something out to be, and watch what you feel like, as unaffected by popular opinion as you can be. Nothing can survive a viewing by someone who has heard nothing other than positives about it, regardless of its quality. The pacing is marvelous; for a running time of three hours, this is not boring at all. It has fun and humorous moments. Is it sappy? I suppose that\\'s up to the individual to judge; I wouldn\\'t say so. There is a bit of violence and disturbing content, infrequent mild to moderate language, a little sexuality(hinted at) and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10 TITANIC (1997) **** Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, Suzi Amis, Frances Fisher, Victor Garber, David Warner. The most expensive film ever made and worth every penny (some $200 million!) that now ranks the international blockbuster box office champ in cinema history ($600 million plus!!) : filmmaker James Cameron\\'s labor of love and exquisite depiction and detail obsession pays off in a monumental way in his fictional account of the infamous/tragic maiden (and doomed, final) voyage of the S.S. Titanic focusing on star-crossed lovers (Di Caprio in his star-confirming turn as a steerage passenger and Winslet as a very proper young lady engaged to wealthy cad Zane, all by the way perfect) facing the ultimate tale of survival as the vast ship of luxury and riches slowly begins to sink thanks to its fated collision with an iceberg in The North Sea.\\n\\nSeamlessly edited footage of actual size set of the vessel, digital computer generated effects and visuals of the remains of the real Titanic at the bottom of the ocean eerily woven into a tapestry of visceral impact and execution. The last third of the film of the sinking, mostly in real time, is unforgettable. Cameron pulls off the impossible with perfection despite the odds of being lambasted for the largesse of the film\\'s budget (ironically like the Titanic\\'s own criticism for size over substance). An instant classic that won Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Editing, Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Art Direction, Cinematography, Dramatic Score, Visual Effects, Costume Design and for the ubiquitous yet stirring Best Song \\'My Heart Will Go On\\' sung by Celine Dion. A near sweep (it lost screenplay, actress and supporting actress but not bad: 11 out of 14!) nan \"Titanic\" is really two movies: one of them is an exciting, James Cameron-style action film, \"The Poseidon Adventure\" with better special effects; the other is a dull as dirt period romance, so simplistic and clichÃ© it seems like something conceived in the mind of a twelve-year-old girl.\\n\\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet became household names because of their performances in this, and they do invest the film with a great deal of spunk, but they\\'ve got absolutely terrible material to work with. Cameron is clearly no writer, but he is a good director of action, so just tune in to this one once the big ship has actually hit the iceberg, and you\\'ll save yourself a lot of time.\\n\\nThe supporting cast includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Winslet\\'s uptight and aristocratic mother, Victor Garber as the skipper..er...captain, and Billy Zane, in an embarrassingly awful role as the movie\\'s villain. The character as written is like something out of a silent movie, and Zane plays him as such -- if he had a mustache, he\\'d be twirling it. Too bad his performance is completely at odds with the totally contemporary performances of just about everyone else.\\n\\nCameron reveals an almost fetishistic obsession with recreating the glamour of the famed ocean liner, and the glee with which he then goes about demolishing it and the people on it borders on the disturbing. It\\'s like watching a little boy build an elaborate train set just so he can have the pleasure of blowing it up with firecrackers.\\n\\nGrade: B The special effects are great in this film, and the love story is compelling. Even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out, it is still quite dramatic and interesting. Plus, you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the Academy Award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit - a distinction shared with few films over the last twenty years.\\n\\nHowever, there are a few oversimplifications of the social situation of the passengers in the context of the realities of the early 20th century that bug me every time I watch this movie. First off, there is a heavy handed message of rich = bored and unhappy, poor = genuine and full of life. Given that there was absolutely no social safety net anywhere in the world in 1912, there could be nothing more brutal and grinding than being poor in that era, as if there is any such thing as \"easy poverty\" at any point in history, including today.\\n\\nSecond, and somewhat accompanying the first sticking point, is the idea that Rose will somehow be free to be something out of a 1969 Virginia Slim\\'s commercial if only she can lose that rich stiff she is engaged to (Billy Zane\\'s character, Cal) and run off with kindred free-spirit Jack. This illusion not only confronts the fact of grinding poverty in early 20th century America, this flies in the face of entrenched sexism enshrined in the law during that time that wasn\\'t even confronted as a problem until the 1960\\'s. Who, in 1912, is going to let Rose put on a pair of jeans and ride side-saddle on Coney Island? Let her learn to pilot a plane? Allow her to pursue her career goals unless they involve teaching school, nursing, or performing (i.e. doing something that involves serving men)? And even learning those skills cost money she did not have. The fact is at that time a woman in America or anywhere else in the world was considered property. She could either be the property of a rich man (evil Cal) or a poor man. The only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is Rose\\'s mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again - and she SHOULD be afraid, VERY afraid.\\n\\nI once had a 3rd sticking point, but it has been nullified over the last ten years. That sticking point was that Billy Zane\\'s character could feel so superior and entitled given that his wealth and stature were accidents of birth, not the fruits of his own enterprise and imagination. I have since come to realize that some of the smuggest most entitled people on earth are those that were born into their circumstances, so I withdraw that objection.\\n\\nThis movie did do a service by dispelling the myth that the slogan on the Titanic was \"women and children first\", when it was, in fact, \"first class women and children first\". In reality, if you were a first-class woman, you had a 97% chance of survival, and just about every first class woman that did die chose to stay behind because she did not want to leave her husband. If you were a female steerage passenger you had about a 45% chance of survival. Worse yet, third class children had a 1 in 3 chance of survival, which was the same rate of survival as the first class men. Not one of either the first or second class children died on the Titanic.\\n\\nThus, I still enjoy the movie immensely, but I think that the false presentation of early 20th century social reality will always bother me a little every time I watch the film. Greetings again from the darkness. Of course I saw this one a couple of times when it was first released in 1997. Having only watched it once since, I was happy to hear it would get a re-release on its 15th anniversary ... even if the marketing hook was the post-production 3D. My thought was with James Cameron working his technical magic, the 3D would be fine, and maybe even add to the spectacle of the sinking ship. After all, he was the mastermind behind Avatar, which with Hugo, are the only two films (in my opinion) that haven\\'t been weakened with 3D technology.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I can\\'t overstate my disappointment in the 3D for Titanic. The colors and lighting are destroyed. When we first see young Rose (Kate Winslet) arrive to board the majestic ocean liner, her lavender hat appears almost gray through the 3D glasses. And later, the crimson Renault, where Rose and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) get to \"know\" each other, appears dull and darkened. Additionally so many face shots are darkened, rather than illuminated by the beautiful fixtures that adorn Titanic. I was so saddened to see such dullness on top of such greatness. Sure, there were a couple of times where the 3D gave a boost to a special effect, but the film is so beautifully made and such a technical marvel, that the impact is minimal to the positive.\\n\\nWhat I will say is that despite my frustration with the technology, I do hope a new generation is introduced to the film. Personally, I am no fan of the love story between Jack and Rose. However, it is such a delight to see the young, eager versions of Little Leo and Kate as they go about their antics. They were 22 and 21 respectively during filming, and we now know them as mature actors and major movie stars. That wasn\\'t the case when Titanic first premiered.\\n\\nThe real genius of this film is two fold: the story-telling and the technical achievement. Gloria Stuart stars as 101 yr old Rose and she is used to perfection in telling the personal story of Titanic. Her love story with Jack allows director Cameron to show off the amazing ship from all angles ... first class, third class, dining rooms and engine rooms. She also allows the viewer to connect with the characters on a personal level. The technical aspect is even more astounding. Sets, models, CGI, and documentary footage are all blended to form a cohesive presentation of one of the most dramatic events of the past 100 years.\\n\\nHere are a few notes of interest regarding the movie and those involved. The movie was number one at the box office for 15 consecutive weeks and grossed more than $1.8 billion ... a record that stood until Cameron\\'s Avatar eclipsed it. Cameron was already an established sci-fi director with Terminator I & II and Aliens, but he almost had the plug pulled by the production company due to cost overruns. Matthew McConaughey was the producer\\'s first choice for Jack, but Cameron held firm for DiCaprio. The elderly couple hugging each other in bed as the ship sinks were based on the Strauss\\' who owned the Macy\\'s department store chain. And yes, there were Astor\\'s and Guggenheim\\'s onboard when it went down. If you have seen the movie before, pay particular attention to the secondary characters ... the wardrobes and acting are tremendous: Francis Fisher as Rose\\'s mother, Karthy Bates as the \"Unsinkable\" Molly Brown, Billy Zane as the fiancÃ©, David Warner as his henchman, Bernard Hill as the Captain, Victor Garber as the architect, and Jonathan Hyde as the sleazy ship owner. Also catch Suzy Amis in one of her last acting jobs before becoming Mrs. James Cameron ... she plays the granddaughter to \"old\" Rose.\\n\\nThis is an historic film version of an historic event and should be seen by all movie lovers. Some of it is a bit hokey, but if you doubt the technical achievement, compare it to A Night to Remember, the 1958 version of the Titanic story. nan I have a personal reason for disliking the grand epic Titanic that swept eleven Academy Awards, but for the purposes of this review, I\\'ll remain as impartial as possible. It won\\'t do anyone any good to know that watching this film on the big screen as a child resulted in lifelong hydrophobia.\\n\\nFrom an artistic standpoint, this movie is flawless. The research and replication of the ill-fated RMS Titanic resulted in an identical duplication. Peter Lamont\\'s production design, Michael Ford\\'s set decoration, and Martin Laing and Charles Lee\\'s art direction is breathtaking. If you spend the entire three hours starting at minute details like dishes, wallpaper, and chandeliers, you\\'ll feel like you\\'re really aboard the ship. The beautiful fashions, designed by Deborah Lynn Scott, are authentic looking and gorgeous. Most of the movie is very beautiful to watch, including the famous dissolve from ruin to reconstruction in the beginning.\\n\\nThis wasn\\'t the first movie about the Titanic, and this version\\'s storyline isn\\'t very interesting. Kate Winslet stars as a high-class lady travelling with her mother, Frances Fisher, and her fiancÃ©, Billy Zane. She meets a low-class American, Leonardo DiCaprio, who won his passage in a card game, and he shows her how to really live and fall in love. Parts of the story are rather weak and feel like they belong in a Disney movie rather than a dramatic epic, but I\\'m sure the love story will please young-minded teenagers.\\n\\nThe beginning of the film recreates finding the remnants of the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean, and a very old woman, Gloria Stuart, tells her memory of the voyage. There are a few cuts back and forth from Gloria\\'s story to the 1912 timeline, but once the iceberg is hit, the rest of the film is shown in real-time, which is an interesting touch and a great feat accomplished by director James Cameron and his co-editors Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris. However, during the last portion of the film, there are a few flaws that aren\\'t hard to catch, the most obvious being a lack of foam in the seawater. The literally freezing water doesn\\'t make anyone\\'s teeth chatter until they\\'re submerged, but if enclosed in iceberg-infested waters up to one\\'s thighs, symptoms of the cold would absolutely be seen. In a romantic gesture, Kate Winslet is seen trudging her way through the water in her extremely heavy petticoats, but she wouldn\\'t have been able to move so quickly if her legs were being frozen and the weight of her thick dress material were added to the mix.\\n\\nSo, depending on your point of view, you can fall in love with this beautiful splendor, full of iconic moments and a memorable theme and song. You can lose yourself in the historical replications or spend your time searching for flaws, which you\\'ll find. I won\\'t ever watch the movie again, but let me know what you think!\\n\\nKiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since there are scary situations that scarred me for life, I wouldn\\'t let my kids watch it. James Cameron directed this massive blockbuster hit about the ill-fated maiden voyage of the Titanic in April 1912. Among the many passengers is drifter Jack Dawson(played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who meets unhappy heiress-to-be Rose Dewitt(played by Kate Winslet) and fall mutually in love as disaster strikes the ship, resulting in its sinking, and the loss of many lives. An old version of Rose(played by Gloria Stuart) recounts the romance and tragedy to treasure hunters(led by Bill Paxton) who are looking for a fabled jewel aboard the wreck, which Rose does indeed know something about... Hated by some, resented by others, I still love this film, which works magnificently as a tragic love story and as disaster picture, with outstanding F/X that are still realistic. The full extent of the tragedy is not overshadowed by the romance at all, which is put in proper perspective. Some dialogue could have been better, it\\'s true, but compelling drama at its best, leading to an emotionally devastating end. Deservedly won many Academy Awards, including best picture, director, and song \"My Heart Will Go On\"! First off, this was a rather good flick for me. Nothing to great...I have seen a lot of films since I have seen this one that I like a heck of a lot more, but this was pretty good. A love story set on the Titanic is basically the story with a few plot points about class. Seeing the ship sink of course is the highlight for me cause it really did look good. I saw the actors did alright...I won\\'t badger Leo, I don\\'t hold anything against a guy just because lots of gals like him, I just call him a lucky bast#rd and be done with it. Kate looks pretty good in this flick and does a rather good job as well. Like I said though the boat sinking is the highlight and one complaint I have is that there wasn\\'t enough character developement of other characters besides Leo\\'s and Kate\\'s...I have posted some theories on why I think it grossed so much on the message board here, because frankly I think it was a fluke it did gross so much, but I am not saying it was a bad flick. The hype surrounding James Cameron\\'s \"Titanic\" when it was released during Christmas, 1997, and early 1998 was so great that it worked against the film in a way. Few films could live up to such ballyhoo. Nevertheless, viewing it apart from the mass hoopla, it shines in all-around greatness.\\n\\nThe movie of course details the doomed maiden voyage of the magnificent Titanic from April 10-15, 1912. This is one of the greatest tragedies in human history. There were only enough lifeboats for half of the over 2200 men, women and children aboard. Why? Because the Titanic was so great they thought she was unsinkable. When it was all over only a little over 700 people survived and 1500 people went to their grave in the cold North Atlantic.\\n\\nThis is a movie and not a documentary and, as such, includes a fictional drama to hook the viewer. This is where people will either embrace the film or criticize it. As far as I\\'m concerned, the story of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) is excellent. Rose is only 17 years old and is being forced by her fearful mother (Frances Fisher) to marry the pompously rich Cal (Billy Zane). Jack, by contrast, is a dirt poor wandering artist who\\'s free as the wind and brims with life, love, and humble honesty.\\n\\nRose instinctively feels trapped and would rather die than marry some fake snob, no matter how handsome and wealthy. She\\'s attracted to Jack because he\\'s the antithesis of Cal. By contrast, her mother views Jack as a threat because she thinks that her only hope of retaining the airs of wealth is through marrying her daughter into a rich family. The \"Unsinkable\" Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is another significant personality. She\\'s new enough to \"high society\" to still relate to the \"commoners\" and so goes out of her way to help Jack and his brushes with the stuffy aristocracy. Thrown into the mix is Cal\\'s priceless diamond necklace for Rose and what happens to it.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, there\\'s a modern story (1996 anyway) that brackets the main plot. Bill Paxton stars as a treasure hunter obsessed with the necklace, Suzy Amis as Rose\\'s granddaughter and Gloria Stuart as old-aged Rose. Gloria was 85-86 years old during filming and she just shines in the role.\\n\\nThe casting and acting is exceptional, particularly the main performers. It\\'s no wonder that DiCaprio and Winslet went on to great success. In addition, the depictions of the vessel and her tragic sinking are magnificent.\\n\\nYet it\\'s the powerful subtext that inspires most. What good is great wealth without love, virtue, respect and freedom? In her untainted teenage idealism, Rose would rather die than have this. Jack lacks the former but possesses the latter and, therefore, possesses the former as well, even if you can\\'t see it (if you know what I mean). Rose instinctively senses this and therefore throws all caution to the wind. Some criticize that she goes too far by prematurely getting intimate in the vehicle, but â\\x80\\x93 remember â\\x80\\x93 she grew-up with her life-stifling, greedy, fear-mongering mother and so when she finally gets away from her clutches she naturally goes overboard. Have some compassion!\\n\\nAs for the fate of the necklace (***SPOILER***), Rose didn\\'t cash-in on the diamond because she didn\\'t want to rely on Cal for money; and she didn\\'t give it to her granddaughter or the treasure-hunter because it wasn\\'t hers to give. Since the insurance company paid out on the policy Cal\\'s dad took out on it, the diamond belonged to the insurance company if found; it was no longer the property of Hockley or his heirs, and it wasn\\'t the property of Rose either, because it was not made over to her by a deed of gift or a bequest. She came into possession of it by mistake and so was obligated by law to turn it over to the rightful owners or, if that was not possible, to legal authorities. More importantly, the necklace was a reminder of her promise to Jack to \"Never let go.\" She thus throws it into the ocean because she had fulfilled her promise to live life to the fullest and was now ready let go, particularly since she finally returned to Jack\\'s watery grave (***END SPOILER***).\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t be right to fail to acknowledge the great score by James Horner and the theme song sung by Celine Dion. Great movies are great because their producers take the time & effort to achieve excellence on every level.\\n\\nNeedless to say, because the film runs 3 hours and 14 minutes you have to be in the mood for a long movie to fully appreciate \"Titanic.\"\\n\\nGRADE: A TITANIC, that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, James Cameron\\'s Magnum Opus, continues to impress, especially when viewed yet again on New Year\\'s Day 2012 - a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from Hollywood. One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems - the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why - and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.\\n\\nBut for many the manner in which Cameron sets the tone of the story, the reminiscence of the elderly Rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship Keldysh attempting to raise the Titanic now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film, seems more cogent today than even at movie\\'s release. Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch. From there the opulence of the \\'unsinkable\\' Titanic unfolds and the gradual love affair between Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) and poor artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a relationship at risk from the brewings of Rose\\'s mother (Frances Farmer) and Rose\\'s intended (Billly Zane). The cruise lasted from April 10, 1912 to April 15, 1912, but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young lovers.\\n\\nIn retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note: Ioan Gruffudd, Victor Garber, David Warner, Danny Nucci etc. The film could have used some editing to reduce the length, and the presence of the unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates in a wasted role) though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit. Still TITANIC is just that - titanic - and no matter how many times we see it, it never fails to impress.\\n\\nGrady Harp nan I understand why every Dick and Jane on the planet liked this, but why did the critics give it such good reviews? I mean, it is not, contrary to popular opinion, the worst movie ever made (although, yes, it may be the most overhyped, although The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode 1 are huge contenders). It is merely bad. There are very few things to like in this film. Technically, it succeeds to a point. I really did believe that I was watching a real ship sink (well, since the model built by Cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a full-sized ship, it ought to look real!). Some of the CGI was terrible, though. The people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that I laughed a bit. The writing is extraordinarily weak. Dialogue is just as bad. Everything that happened in the film, which takes over 3 hours, can easily be related on a cocktail napkin. The worst part about it has to be the acting. Kate Winslet has actually been good, elsewhere, but here she has nothing to work with. DiCaprio is bad. There\\'s no saving him - his career, much like that of a boy band, is going down the toilet as I type (he\\'s starting to gain weight and get greasy like Marlon Brando did - this sort of right is only reserved for actors of Brando\\'s status, so stop it now, Leo!). Billy Zane is awful, too, but it is mostly that his part is so insubstantial.\\n\\nSo do you believe in payolas? It\\'s beginning to make me curious that such obviously bad films as Titanic, American Pie, and The Matrix all got rave reviews from critics. All three of the films were abominations. And you may ask, what does it matter if a critic reviews it well? I don\\'t care about their opinion! Not true, my friend. Even if your insecurities tell you that critics are unimportant, you always secretly feel victory when the consensus is for a film you really like. Therefore, there are no guilty feelings after you have enjoyed something like Titanic so much. Instead, you feel for a fading second that, yes, you are part of high culture. You understand art. BLAH! It\\'s all just sinister psychology working its claws over simple minds.\\n\\nAnd for those of you who absolutely despise this film, I can guess your favorite pictures: Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Fight Club, and, of course, The Matrix. Well, you people should actually begin to learn what REAL film is. Rent A Night to Remember, the best film about the Titanic\\'s sinking. It is not the greatest film ever made, but it is great. Well, it\\'s not \"Avatar\" levels of disappointment, but \"Titanic\" is far from Cameron\\'s best work. Don\\'t get me wrong, there\\'s a great disaster epic here, but you\\'ve gotta work for it. The actual iceberg doesn\\'t appear until 100 minutes in. A hundred. That\\'s a lot of forced love story to slog through before real dread starts to build. And the less said about that song, the better.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t a bad movie, and it\\'s technically proficient when the effects take center stage. When it\\'s actually about White Star Line\\'s monumental hubris, and the destruction raining down (or washing in) the spectacle lives up to the director\\'s name.\\n\\nBut the rest of it . . .\\n\\n5/10 It was brave of James Cameron to attempt an undertaking on this scale. Making the world\\'s most expensive movie ever is always to tempt fate; the film which had previously held that distinction, the Kevin Costner vanity project \"Waterworld\", had been a disaster in both financial and artistic terms. Even before \"Titanic\" was finished, rumours were circulating that it would be equally disastrous; the critics began preparing their \"sinking ship\" metaphors in anticipation of its failure.\\n\\nIn the event, of course, the critics were confounded; the film was a great success, both at the box office and with the Academy, who awarded it eleven Oscars including best picture and best director. It became the most talked-about film of 1997. Eight years on there have been other films on a similar epic scale and some of the excitement it provoked has died away. Nevertheless, even today it stands out as a fine achievement.\\n\\n\"Titanic\" combines two quite different genres, the disaster movie and the \"heritage\" costume drama. The late nineties saw a modest revival of the disaster picture, that quintessentially seventies genre, with \"Twister\" in 1996 and \"Dante\\'s Peak\" and \"Volcano\" the following year. Cameron took the basic formula for such films and applied it to a real historical event, making a film on a grand scale with lavish attention to period detail. The real Titanic sinking had a number of features which fitted the genre; it is something of a convention of disaster movies that the disaster should be caused, or at least exacerbated, by the incompetence or complacency of those in authority, an element emphasised here. Bruce Ismay, the Chairman of the White Star Line, proudly proclaims the ship unsinkable, then causes the disaster by urging the captain to steam at top speed through an ice-field. To make matters worse, the company have neglected to provide sufficient lifeboats for all on board.\\n\\nCameron also imported into the film some of the conventions of \"heritage cinema\". That genre has often been used to examine the British class system, often in films which feature romances between individuals from different social backgrounds, such as Losey\\'s \"The Go-Between\" or Merchant-Ivory productions like \"Howard\\'s End\". Cameron takes the same concept and uses the film to examine the historical roots of the American class system, of which the ship, with its first, second and third class passengers, is a microcosm. Intertwined with the story of the tragedy is the story of the romance between Rose Dewitt Bukater, daughter of an aristocratic Philadelphia family, and Jack Dawson, a struggling artist from a working-class background.\\n\\nThe America that we see is not, as is sometimes said, a classless society, nor even one where class is solely determined by wealth. The Dewitt Bukaters, for all their old-money pretensions, are in financial difficulties, and Rose\\'s late father died heavily in debt. Rose\\'s mother Ruth sees that the only way to maintain the family\\'s social status will be if Rose makes a \"good\" marriage to a wealthy man, and a seemingly ideal candidate has presented himself in the shape of Cal Hockley, the son of a nouveau-riche industrialist. Unfortunately, Cal is an arrogant, selfish snob, and Rose cannot bear the thought of marriage to him. She considers suicide by throwing herself off the ship, but is dissuaded from doing so by Jack, and the two fall in love.\\n\\nSome have criticised the film for concentrating on the romance of Jack and Rose, arguing that this focus is somehow demeaning to a real-life tragedy in which over a thousand people died. This is not a criticism with which I would agree. It would clearly have been impossible to tell the personal stories of all those who died; Cameron\\'s aim was to put the disaster into context and heighten its impact by giving us two characters we can care about and to make their story representative of the stories of all those caught up in the drama, thus heightening the film\\'s emotional impact.\\n\\nThe film has a number of weaknesses. The liberties taken with historical accuracy, such as the denigration of the character of William Murdoch (who in real life died bravely), can sometimes seem offensive. The opening scenes and closing, which deal with the attempts of a modern salvage team to recover from the wreck a valuable jewel given by Cal to Rose, were possibly unnecessary and certainly overlong, and could easily have been pruned. The acting is not always very good; I was less than impressed by Leonardo Di Caprio as Jack. (In fairness it must be said that he has greatly improved as an actor since 1997, having given a good performance in \"Catch Me If You Can\" and an excellent one in \"The Aviator\"). Kate Winslet as Rose was better, although even she fell short of the brilliance she had shown in \"Heavenly Creatures\".\\n\\nThe weaknesses are, however, greatly outweighed by the film\\'s strengths. A special mention must go to James Horner\\'s evocative score and Celine Dion\\'s song \"My Heart Will Go On\". There are a number of good performances in minor roles, from Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, shunned as vulgar by her fellow first-class passengers but more good-hearted than any of them, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, a decent man but without the strength of character to stand up to Ismay\\'s bullying, and Frances Fisher as Ruth, a woman who puts her social status ahead of her daughter\\'s happiness. In the end, however, this is not a film one watches for the acting. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the real star is neither Kate nor Leo but rather the great ship itself, particularly during the spectacular scenes after it hits the iceberg. The success of \"Titanic\" gave Hollywood back the self-confidence to make pictures on a grand scale with daring, energy and imagination, leading to recent epics such as \"Gladiator\" and \"Troy\". 8/10 nan I gave this film a bad review on IMDb in 2002. I deleted my review today - mainly because I don\\'t agree with it anymore. In fact, I\\'m not so sure I totally agreed with it when I wrote it. I felt an obligation to hate this movie because people who like it are typically made fun of. But I have to admit: I _do_ like it.\\n\\nYes, the romantic subplot is silly to the extent that Jack would never find himself anywhere near Rose to begin with. But you know what? The romance provides a nice outlet through which to frame the actions of the Titanic\\'s sinking. A three-hour movie about random people on a boat that\\'s going to sink would be a true bore. James Cameron - despite his personal flaws - is a great storyteller and by focusing on characters before heading on to the carnage, he builds a relationship with the viewer. Think of any good historical movie - apart from a few films such as \"The Longest Day,\" most of the time there\\'s a story taking place around the event.\\n\\nAs for \"Titanic\" - some people will feel offended. Some people will hate the romantic subplot and find the entire thing unbearably hokey. Some people will make fun of Leonardo DiCaprio (although, thankfully, that phase seems to have passed and he now demands more respect as an actor). And some people will just fast-forward to the end so they can see the Titanic sink (and I\\'m really hoping that wasn\\'t a spoiler for anyone - because if it was, you need to go take a middle school history course again).\\n\\nThe acting isn\\'t bad. Leonardo DiCaprio picked up a lot of misery for his acting here. But he\\'s gone on since to prove, like Johnny Depp, that he\\'s more than just a pretty face. His performances in films such as \"The Aviator\" and \"Catch Me If You Can\" echo his early work in \"What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape?\" - he\\'s one of this generation\\'s finest actors. It\\'s no wonder Scorsese enjoys working with him so much. It may almost seem absurd to even make this comparison, but after some of his recent films DiCaprio has struck me as another Robert De Niro: he has the talent and the intelligence. It\\'s a shame the success of \"Titanic\" pushed him back for a few years.\\n\\nKate Winslet, on the other hand, is a nice contrast against DiCaprio, however I didn\\'t totally buy their romance at all times and they\\'re not the best screen couple in cinema history by any means. Meanwhile, in the Villain Department, Billy Zane is, for once, not bald.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t think you\\'ll like it, you probably won\\'t. It\\'s one of those films that people either love or hate. If you didn\\'t like \"Braveheart\" there\\'s a good chance you\\'ll hate this as well.\\n\\nIf you can watch it with an open mind, however, and accept its romantic angle, you may enjoy it. nan To admit this is the first time I have watched TITANIC from A to Z might hinder my credibility as a serious film critic (as least a self-acclaimed title), I have had several sketchy viewings during all these years but never conquered it entirely, then all of sudden it occurred to me a few days ago this is the biggest loophole in my filmography which I should mend ASAP, so after the lengthy 3 hour saga, now I could feel calmer in facing the numerous household names still stuck in my to-be-watched list and meanwhile other potential newcomers have never stopped emerging.\\n\\nTo be honest with oneself, no one could deny TITANIC is a monumental masterpiece, the visual stunts are so compelling and marvel me in its verisimilitude of reconstructing such a monolith setting (what\\'s more indomitable is the fact that it has survived a 15 year interval which should have been a light-year in the evolution of digital technology, and will still stand out not only among its peers). Also the film is a well-crafted emotional vehicle of a catastrophe depicting in an impeccable way to render immaculate empathy towards its audience as if we were literally heading towards our own doomsday (I did redden my eyes when the valedictory score was accompanying the final farewell).\\n\\nThe love story of Jack and Rose, although being a bit predictable and the black or white of the character development is somewhat perfunctory given the ample running time it has, could universally strike a chord in any corner of the world, DiCaprio and Winslet have generated unparalleled chemistry on screen (especially for Kate, since she has a more narrative arc to accomplish). Billy Zane, whose past 15 years has testified that he could never outshine this tailor-made character. Gloria Stuart and Katy Bates are both in my top 10 list of the supporting category, and since I\\'m re-watching DOWNTON ABBEY these days, whose correlation with TITANIC has suggested that all the first-class passengers don\\'t need to change any outfit to be grafted into the red-hot show, maybe Katy Bates could reprise her role as the survival of the calamity, Julian Fellowes might give it a shot.\\n\\nTo be the all-time highest grossing film in North America, and the runner-up if put under the international parameter (after Cameron\\'s own brooding AVATOR 2009, 9/10), TITANIC has every reason to be loved by the majority of the mass, and it may not be among the top- tier darling among orthodox film critics, but will remain as a tenacious one in my list. Another afterthought is that I hope AVATOR will look as fabulous as TITANIC now when 2024 eventually arrives. nan Titanic was not as good as I was hoping it to be.... I was disappointed in the film. I want to like this film because Leonardo DiCaprio is in the film because I like him - he\\'s a great actor! But I could not get past the fictional romance the movie was focused on. I was hoping for more of a documentary type of a film but, alas, it was not so.\\n\\nThe casting and acting was quite good! The set was realistic as well. There are good moments in the movie so I can\\'t knock it completely.\\n\\nIDK, maybe I will have to be alone and in a romantic mood to enjoy this movie more than I actually did the first couple times I viewed it. Or, maybe, I really did want a modern documentary type of movie on The Titanic.\\n\\nI hate to dislike this film but I do. It\\'s a movie I should at least like better than I do but I do not. I have to rate the film low due to the fictional romance the film was focused on.\\n\\n6/10 I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it\\'s about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it\\'s engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90\\'s and it\\'s still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.\\n\\n7.9/10 This is an epic tragedy movie about aristocrat Rose DeWitt Bukater falling in love with poor artist Jack Dawson, aboard the doomed Titanic. It is a beautiful but typical love story that captures the audience\\'s hearts, providing a compelling subplot among the more tragic main story of the ill-fated voyage.\\n\\nMany of the movie\\'s element was directed with excellence: the actors provided a solid and believable performance; the cinematography was beautiful; the music score was moving; and the sceneries and settings aboard the ship, amidst the flashy and famed lifestyles of aristocracy and amidst the poor but carefree lives of the townspeople and artists, were brilliant.\\n\\nThe scenes of each character\\'s fate after the Titanic started sinking is extremely powerful, haunting, and sometimes disturbing. The film quickly shifts from an emotional love story, which I thought was, unfortunately, pretty boring, to a heart-wrenching tragedy that cannot help but send chills down your spine (where most of the action lies).\\n\\nThis movie is a little on the long side though, with several filler scenes that drag away from the main plot. Some sequences of Jack and Rose were pretty clichÃ© - reminding you too much of a teenage-bop love story. While I am not a big drama fan, this movie is a good exception for pure, dramatic entertainment, but not one I would watch over and over again.\\n\\nGrade C I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. \"It was so great,\" she said. \"You really felt like you were on the ship.\" \"Nonsense,\" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, \"you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she\\'ll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested.\" \"Well, maybe,\" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. \"OK,\" I thought, \"I\\'ll give it a look see.\" I didn\\'t want to like it - and I didn\\'t. I loved it! What a great movie.\\n\\nWhere to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost \"you are there\" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don\\'t just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet\\'s being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect \"t\" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose\\'s mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I\\'m no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion\\'s performance of \"My Heart Goes On.\"\\n\\nProblems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don\\'t accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he\\'s been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.\\n\\nA minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.\\n\\n9/10 Seeing as Titanic is one of the most financially successful films of all time and whose storyline is know by almost everybody, I have decided not to base this review so much on the content of the film. Instead I would prefer to to look at how this movie is in fact something of a one-off historically.\\n\\nThe uniqueness of Titanic in film history is down to a couple of inter-related things. Firstly, it stands apart as being a picture that combines state-of-the-art special effects technology within the frame-work of a romantic epic. Never before or since has this been done and it goes some way to explain the film\\'s phenomenal success. This leads onto the other element of Titanic that is unusual â\\x80\\x93 the fact that a mega-budget blockbuster was quite clearly aimed primarily at women. Again, in the age of the blockbuster this tactic is just not the done thing. James Cameron has always been an action film director who is very female-aware. From Aliens through to Avatar, his movies always feature unusually strong women in central roles; often as the main identifiable action figure. So perhaps it\\'s not, therefore, surprising that with Titanic Cameron should create the ultimate female-centric special-effects blockbuster. This approach paid off of course, women especially went in droves to see it, and the film went super-nova at the box-office.\\n\\nFor the first half of the film we have a romance. A cross-class romance that is doomed from the start, in the same way as we all know the famous ocean liner is. The parallels between these two story lines ultimately compliment each other â\\x80\\x93 the love story gives the disaster a personal edge, while in turn, the disaster gives the love story an epic tragic quality. The first time I watched the film I thought the romantic plot was an unnecessary and annoying addition, the second time I began to understand that it gives the film an emotional basis that it feeds off. I now have a great deal more respect for this most unfashionable and often vilified of Hollywood movies. It\\'s uniqueness in film history too in terms of its approach and audience demographic is also something worth at least a little respect. It\\'s unusual combination of special-effects driven action with period-set romance is not likely to be repeated very soon, and Titanic, therefore, will at the very least remain a one-off in film history. nan The big daddy of disaster movies, less a full stop than a triple exclamation mark to the sub-genre. Like a modern-day De Mille, James Cameron sets out a 3 hour plus movie and delays the big event, the encounter with the iceberg, until more than halfway through the feature, confident that by that stage he has the expectant audience in his grip and can hold them for another ninety minutes till the end. I seem to remember lengthy movies like \"Ben Hur\", \"Ryan\\'s Daughter\" or of course \"Gone With The Wind\" coming with an intermission roughly halfway through but there\\'s no such break here as Cameron knows that by the time the water starts to pour into the stricken ship, no one will want to leave their seat.\\n\\nThe big question of course is does he do enough in that first 100 minutes to make us care for the central characters he\\'s created, namely Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s Jack and Kate Winslet\\'s Rose. He contrives a highly improbable story around the king of all Magoffins, a long-lost priceless diamond which appears to be the motivation for today\\'s treasure-seeking expedition and asks us to accept that a still-alive 101 year old lady, the subject of a nude portrait found onboard depicted wearing the diamond, holds the key as to its whereabouts.\\n\\nYes, that framing story, rather like the unlucky Titanic itself, doesn\\'t hold much water when held up to examination being a florid slice of highly-theatrical melodrama, complete with its own pantomime villain in the shape of Billy Zane and I\\'ll be honest in that once the calamity occurs I cared as much, indeed more about the hundreds of fellow-passengers teeming behind the leads, as I knew that they weren\\'t really fictional and represented the 1500 lives lost that day.\\n\\nPutting that aside though, it\\'s all about the effects which even looked at now, almost 25 years on, are truly remarkable. From the ship\\'s engine-room, to its grand dining room and outer decks, the magnificence of the boat is wonderfully recreated while the the fateful crash into the iceberg, the panic which followed, the sinking of the boat and the chilling aftermath of the dead and dying strewn across the freezing Atlantic are conveyed with \"You are there\"-type realism.\\n\\nDespite what I said about the importance of the SFX to the whole enterprise, it\\'s impossible to deny the charm of DiCaprio and Winslet\\'s performances and their own chemistry in bringing their highly idealised characters to life, but there\\'s no question at all that the boat is the real star here. \"Titanic\" was the cinematic phenomenon of the 90\\'s and the worldwide highest grossing film of all time before being dethroned by \"Avatar\", from James Cameron (the only director who could ever beat James Cameron in the box-office). Now, \"Titanic\" has become the quintessential cool-to-hate film, hence one of the most controversial Best Picture winners, which is surprising because if anything, the movie screams \\'Best Picture\\'.\\n\\nThere\\'s something quite unique in the way the huge success of \"Titanic\" became a defining key of detestation, challenging any attempt for a rational appreciation. Well, we\\'re in 2011 now : the hype has passed, CGI became a tiresome trend providing a series of unoriginal special-effects-driven films, Kate won an Oscar and Scorsese injected some cinematic botox on Leo\\'s ex-pretty-boy face. In these circumstances, I believe we have enough distance to judge \"Titanic\" again, regardless of all the peripheral elements that contributed to its success, back then, in 1997 Â\\x85\\n\\nWhen \"Titanic\" was released, I was the kind of teenager who avoided any mainstream phenomenon, needless to say that I categorically refused to be brainwashed by the \"Titanic\" wave. The film was the absolute must-see and the girls were all drooling over Di Caprio, and you couldn\\'t listen to the radio or watch TV musical programs without having the annoying flute of Celine Dion\\'s \"My Heart Will Go On\". I was far from imagining that this music would define my personal nostalgia of the late 90\\'s. Then the movie grabbed 11 Oscars, it was the most watched and re-watched film ever and I even had to make an essay about \"Titanic\" at school, where I eagerly expressed that the \\'Iceberg story left me cold\\'\\n\\nBut suddenly something strange happened. The bubble of popularity popped, some little fellows displayed a childish pride of having disliked the film. And I can\\'t count how many girls were so pleased to say that Leo was too girlish, when one year before, he had an \\'angel face\\'. Then I reversed my position, and from the enthusiasm of having avoided the film, I wanted to understand why people were being so hypocritical with their own appreciation, and feel guilty as if they admired a naked Emperor, with all flash and no substance. This is how \"Titanic\" gradually became the \\'cool-to-hate\\' film, because it\\'s always cool to hate popular stuff, but it\\'s so uncool to try to be cool so this was my personal encouragement to give it a chance in 1999, and to know where I stood for. I came, I saw and I liked it.\\n\\nI\\'m not even afraid to admit that I loved it, it had everything I was expecting, it was spectacular, thrilling, romantic, and didn\\'t rely too much on special effects except for the terrific sinking part. Yes, the film flirts with cinematic clichÃ©s sometimes, the whole \\'follow your heart\\' message is almost Disney-like, but this is the point of the film, it\\'s the romance with the Titanic as a setting, not the Titanic\\'s story featuring a romance. When we think of \"Titanic\", we have less the image of the ship breaking in half in our minds, than Kate and Leo flying over the sunset, this is the defining image of the film and one of the most iconic of American Cinema. And this is the strength of the film.\\n\\nA few recent movies have managed to achieve a classic status so quickly, and so impacting the way \"Titanic\" did and this is certainly due to the constant symbiosis between the story and the special effects that provided the \\'classic\\' vibe, and whether it was intentional or not, it sure succeeded. \"Titanic\" has the thrills, the romance, and an inspirational message, simple enough to appeal to all the sensitive hearts all over the world. And seriously, let\\'s not get too cynical about the marketing campaign, and deny the artistic value of some of the most financially successful films. There\\'s a time for Independent films and another one for spectacular blockbusters Â\\x85 as long as there is a good story, justifying the use of special effects, and the exhilarating sinking sequence.\\n\\n\"Titanic\" had the intelligence to have a sort of classic story that could appeal on a universal level. A love story undermined by a tragedy, it\\'s sad and inspiring, a love story between a rich aristocratic woman and a third-class youthful and optimistic boy, it\\'s universal, the whole tragedy of the \"Titanic\" has been touched by a cinematic grace that made it one of the greatest American classics, and I mean \\'great\\' in the classic meaning of the world. And I better take an innocent story, even naive, rather than a spectacular but dull one, like \"Independence Day\" one year before or a thought-provoking but manipulative one, like \"Saving Private Ryan\" the year after.\\n\\nSo, I loved \"Titanic\", I felt for the characters, the part where one mother reads a story for her children while the ship sinks will haunt me forever, the music beautifully conveys the innate sadness of a rather passionate romance. The film revives the greatest tradition of the disaster genre with a perfectionism that finally paid-off, and I applaud James Cameron for that. And now, I wonder what the haters hate in the film, what makes \"Lord of the Rings\" so deeper than \"Titanic\", love story, good vs. evil? Don\\'t they miss the young Leo who could smile and shout even the cringe-worthy \"king of the world\" line? Regarding the actual cinematic trends, \"Titanic\" is a classic among the classics and the deserving Best Picture of 1997.\\n\\nSo, I don\\'t find any particular reason to hate this film, and if I ever found one, let\\'s say Â\\x85 uh, the part with the necklace which I didn\\'t really care for, well, for one reason to dislike the film, I can find ten to love it. Disliking \"Titanic\" just because it was once so popular is simply a titanic mistake Superficially, the loss of the Titanic is a strange theme for a movie, since we all know what happened before it even starts. But \"Apollo 13\", despite its faults, showed that a story of this sort (albeit one with a happier ending) can still succeed through a low-key focus on the human condition in a state of adversity. For \"Titanic\", however, writer-director James Cameron has chosen to embellish the facts with a predictable and cliched romance, in which Kate Winslet\\'s feisty, intelligent (and way too modern) heroine overcomes the stupidities and rigidities of her privileged background to learn about herself and life through the love of Leonardo diCaprio. Boy-man diCaprio appears hopelessly miscast, playing a \"man of the world\" in the fashion of the lead in a high school rom-com. In fact, his role is a pretty straight reprise of his Romeo in Baz Luhrmann\\'s brilliant Shakespeare adaptation - but whereas the whole of that film was imaginatively conceived so that this character worked in that role, in Titanic he is desperately unconvincing in a piece of social commentary that prefers corn to meat at every opportunity.\\n\\nYet oddly the film is compelling to watch, at least until the iceberg hits, precisely because you know what must come in the end. But when the boat starts to sink, so does the film. When the natural drama of the situation begins to climax, Cameron focuses instead on the ludicrous personal melodrama of his leads, and an extended action sequence that makes \"Star Wars\" seem believable by comparison. The final sinking, by contrast, is actually quite moving, though needless to say, presented with a minimum of economy.\\n\\nOverall, \"Titanic\" is a contradictory film. Its massive budget shows in the beautiful attention to visual detail (particularly in the mighty portrayal of the engine room), and the bombastic force with which the director combines the private and the public sides of an unquestionably massive movie. But it also shows in the good-versus-evil plotting, the way that every scene is milked for more than it\\'s worth, the need to tie everything up with a semi-satisfying moral knot, and the general violation of the principle of Occam\\'s razor (i.e. \"it is vain to do with many what can be done with fewer\"). Both an awesome spectacle and a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood, \"Titanic\" is a true film of its era. But watch \"Das Boot\" instead for a real maratime epic. \\'Titanic (1997)\\' is bogged down by arguably unnecessary modern day sequences, its run-time sailing well beyond the time it actually took for its eponymous ship to sink. These opening and closing moments are what started Cameron\\'s seemingly unending obsession with deep-sea documentation and, in some ways, seem a little too indulgent. However, they do add a layer of theming to the thing and sort of explain the director\\'s motives in making a massively budgeted, romantically focused epic out of one of the most well-known tragedies of the twentieth century. Once the piece progresses into its bulk, it starts to become a lot more interesting. The film revels in its splendid set-design and CG-enhanced environments, marvelling at its own ability to aptly convey the period and paying immense attention to even the smallest of details (though it\\'s apparently content with \\'filling in the gaps\\' any way it pleases). At times, the picture feels rather self-congratulatory, to be honest. However, this confidence is mostly well-placed; the movie did, after all, make over a billion dollars. Just because it made money doesn\\'t mean it\\'s automatically good, though. It\\'s undeniably messy and slow, somewhat confused as to whether it wants to be a straight-forward historical tragedy or an alternate-history \\'against all odds\\' romance (and that\\'s not even mentioning the reflexive, somewhat self-aware vibes of the modern day stuff). Having said that, it\\'s effective on more than one occasion. Some of the romantic banter between its leads is charming, as is their overall relationship, and the \\'clash of the classes\\' angle is generic but enjoyable. Any time DiCaprio and Winslet share the screen, the film is fairly entertaining. However, it doesn\\'t get properly gripping until the DVD asks you to change disks halfway through. This latter half is dedicated, almost entirely, to the sinking of the ship. This is a well-known fact and, frankly, a key selling point of the picture, so it isn\\'t exactly a surprise. Yet, the extended sequence does a good job of maintaining tension by introducing mini conflicts which don\\'t have a pre-determined end. This segment contains some visually spectacular stuff, as water floods corridors or crushes characters against gates and the whole ship turns on its side as it sinks to the depths below. Thankfully, this stuff isn\\'t beautiful; it\\'s devastating. Some of it is really suspenseful, too. It\\'s the most successful aspect of the piece, for sure - although it does feature a shot that demonstrates literally the worst \\'face replacement\\' I\\'ve ever seen. When it comes down to it, the flick isn\\'t as impactful as it should have been. It struggles to balance its two major elements, feels unnecessarily long and is often somewhat self-indulgent (and, thus, rather dull). It is, however, a visually spectacular and occasionally charming experience with a highly effective final third. It\\'s long and uneven, but it\\'s probably worth a go if you\\'re a fan of DiCaprio, Winslet, Cameron or, somewhat strangely, historical tragedies. 6/10 nan James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. I have never seen him make a bad movie. This and his most recent Avatar are in the top ten of my favorite all time films. I know when a movie is very good is when I choke up. I did that for several scenes in this three-hour epic. The wonderful score by James Horner initiated some of those teardrops.\\n\\nThis is about the fateful night in mid-April of 1912 when the luxury liner Titanic sank. Also, there is a romance story between a guy from the lower class and a girl from the upper class.\\n\\nThe acting is pretty great. Yes there were some cheesy lines but so what. The brilliant performances of Kate and Leo make up for it.\\n\\nI can\\'t see why people blast this movie with their criticisms. Maybe it was successful and it made tons of money.\\n\\nOverall, this is one of the best movie of all times. There\\'s a reason why it won eleven Academy awards. I rate this film 10/10. Wow. \"Titanic\" soars effortlessly through 3 hours and 15 minutes and yet you are not exhausted or tired at all. In fact you may be wanting more by the end. James Cameron reached new heights with this film and will always be remembered as the man who directed \"Titanic\". From top to bottom the film is almost perfect. Its special effects and minute details make it a real treasure to behold. One feels as if they are really on that doomed liner. The characters are excellent as well. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart delivered Oscar-nominated performances. Overlooked, but equally potent was Billy Zane in a well-calibrated role. However, Leonardo DiCaprio is just there it seems. His character has mindless dialogue that does become tiring at times. Despite that small problem it is not enough to keep \"Titanic\" from easily being one of the best films of the 1990s. 5 stars out of 5. One of the latest inquiries about this film\\'s re-release was how it is in 3D. Pretty damn dazzling I would say. The details are more enriched, dark scenes are surprisingly crisp & clear and the entire experience is unforgettable. Re-mastered right from the ground up, In 3D, Titanic is a much more intimate experience. The visual effects are still better than most CGI films that comes out these days. Featuring epic depiction of disaster that very few movies can match, exceptional music by James Horner that today is easily one of the most recognizable scores, and last but not the least, James Cameron, who has always pushed the boundaries of technology in film-making to new levels, for crafting it with such care and dedication that it made the whole world fall in love with it, again. So take the journey, fall in love and experience Titanic, like never before. Titanic is a great movie with a very well developed storyline,a fantastic cast and some brilliant character development.James Cameron did an absolutely outstanding job directing this movie,it certainly isn\\'t his best work but it is stunning,the scenery and cinematography is beautiful.The cast is also great,but of course most of the credit has to go to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet,their chemistry is amazing and also the character development for both Jack and Rose is great.Its not the best movie ever,but for being over three hours long it actually goes by very quickly,I would recommend Titanic to anyone looking for a good drama or romance.\\n\\nFollows the love life between two people who meet on the luxurious Titanic.\\n\\nBest Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio Titanic wasn\\'t the first attempt at turning the sinking of the big boat into a theatrical epic, but it\\'s by far the best and will never, ever be bettered. Cameron\\'s minute attention to detail, commitment to realism, and epic vision are light years ahead of the German Propaganda version, a Night to Remember (where the ship sinks whole), the dull Catherine Zeta Jones version, or the tawdry ITV mini-series.\\n\\nThe hugeness of the production is every bit as impressive at the ship, and the savage critics predicted that the film was doomed to fail as hard as its subject matter. Nope! Titanic went on to be a $2 billion hit and scoop 11 Academy Awards.\\n\\nDespite the many positive reviews there are always film snobs who love to pick faults in popular culture phenomenons. But I think Titanic is more than that and doesn\\'t deserve any nit-picking. It\\'s easy to focus on inconsequential details, but Titanic has few faults. The worst I can say of it is that Leo DiCaprio\\'s acting is sometimes a bit aggravating. Apparently Macauley Culkin was considered for the part of Jack Dawson. Now THAT was have been awesome.\\n\\nMany snobs have called the characters flat and uninteresting. It\\'s hard to develop such a wide cast in a film set within a short space of time (not including the 84 year time-span of the story). But the two and a bit days that the ship manages to sail before it sinks does have plenty of drama and development so anyone who complains otherwise is just deliberately being fickle. I don\\'t even think that Billy Zane comes across as a caricature, as others have gleefully pointed out. Caledon Hockley IS actually a complex, and somewhat sympathetic character. I know he\\'s the antagonist (or maybe the iceberg is), but the fact that he still searches for Rose on the deck of the Carpathia means that he really does love her, in a way.\\n\\nOnce the iceberg hits, at the 100-minute mark, the editing and timing (not quite real-time, but close) is perfect. The growing panic matches the rising water as Captain Smith walks around in a daze, completely unable to be believe that it REALLY IS HAPPENING. The hole in the hull doesn\\'t seem to be a problem at first, but two hours later anyone not on a lifeboat is doomed.\\n\\nIn a way it\\'s an end-of-the-world movie as much as a romance or disaster. The Titanic was a microcosm of human society, and despite its status as the biggest ship ever built it really was a tiny, fragile speck on a dark, unforgiving ocean. Even as a child, long before I ever saw the film, I thought that the sinking of it represented the futility of mankind trying to conquer the ocean and the meaningless of wealth.\\n\\nIt\\'s a very different film from Terminator or True Lies, but James Cameron has always kept a gritty, earthy tone to his movie. Titanic isn\\'t, but his commitment to realism keeps it consistent to his other movies.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s the best movie ever, but it scores almost full marks for everything. Titanic deserves to be seen on the big screen, which is why I have only seen it twice. The new 3D conversion looks great, and with a few corrections to the content of the film, and the digital projection itself, now really IS the time to revisit the ship. There is nothing to say about this movie, I think it\\'s a really good movie. I\\'ve watched the movie 17 times and I still don\\'t get bored watching the movie......Excellent actors, excellent script, excellent music and excellent Titanic.... A movie that deserves the Oscars it received until the very end... IMdB score is low I think .Everyone should watch this movie... Greetings from Lithuania.\\n\\nI\\'m a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I\\'m a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work.\\n\\nThis is a storytelling it\\'s at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it\\'s to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven\\'t saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx \"movies\" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that\\'s a rare combination. Movies like this aren\\'t made every day to say the least, and it\\'s shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them.\\n\\nTitanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it\\'s hardly gets better than this. nan nan Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.\\n\\nwhen seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.\\n\\nits not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched\\' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..\\n\\nthe grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).\\n\\nIt is said \\'Titanic\\' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.\\n\\nLeonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word! This movie is about a love story that ends by the hands of an evil iceberg.\\n\\nTitanic was more about romance then about tragedy. The old lady and Jack are pure fiction only the iceberg was real.\\n\\nI say enjoy a good hour of watching people suffer because of an iceberg. This film is a touching epic about two characters aboard the infamous Titanic. It is quite long but it always has something going on to deserve the length. It straddles a fine line between emotion and maudlin, and it can feel a bit clichÃ©d at times, but the acting makes up for it. The whole film is quite engaging and compelling and you really feel for the characters the whole time. \\'Titanic\\' looked so promising, but personally I would say it is the worst film ever made. Not only does it lay aside any consideration of real stories that happened on the ship, but it constructs a piece of ridiculous class-divide mush instead!\\n\\nLeonardo di Caprio (excellent in Romeo + Juliet) and Kate Winslet fail to convince as Jack and Rose, a boy from steerage and a girl from first class. And Billy Zane was downright embarrassing as Rose\\'s stuck-up fiance. There were some good performances - Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, even Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose - but they are few and far between.\\n\\nThe biggest problem I had with the film though was the god-awful script and scenes. Corny lines (\\'as we walk through the valley of death\\'/\\'could you walk a little faster?\\'). The scene in the car where the windows mist up just at the crucial moment. The ridiculous pose at the head of the ship. And perhaps worst of all, the clean water and the fact that Winslet keeps travelling in the lift - downwards - as the ship floods.\\n\\nWatching \\'Titanic\\' for me was a total waste of over 3 hours and an excruciating experience. May I never have the misfortune to see even a minute of it again. For those who were of serious movie-watching age in 1997, \"Titanic\" was more than just a movie...it was a cultural milestone. In an era before the Internet was as omnipresent as it is today, \"Titanic\" still managed to transcend its celluloid and become part of pop culture lore. It easily vaulted to the top of the all-time charts (though has now been passed by \"Avatar\" and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\"). However, along the way \"Titanic\" gained a bit of a reputation as a \"chick flick\", what with \"dreamy Leo\" and the somewhat schmaltzy romance between him and Kate Winslet\\'s character. Fortunately, what I\\'ve learned after a recent re-watch of the film is that it still manages to hold up as an epic for all-comers (at least for the most part) despite its branding as sappy.\\n\\nFor a basic plot summary, \"Titanic\" tells the story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), both passengers on the maiden (and obviously final) voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic. Rose is a member of the \"upper crust\" first class, pledged to be wed to the stodgy, controlling Cal (Billy Zane). Jack is a free-wheeling vagabond who wins his ticket in a poker game just minutes before the ship departs. On the first night of the voyage, Rose has a breakdown and is about to jump from the bow of the ship...until she is stopped by the charming Jack. A Romeo and Juliet-esque romance begins, coming to a head when the great boat strikes an iceberg and beings taking on water.\\n\\nThe main reason I can appreciate \"Titanic\" is because I like films that really \"go for it\", so to speak. \"Titanic\" is meant to be an epic, and director/creator James Cameron pulls out all the stops to make that happen. The visually sequences are stunning (the CGI is a bit visible by today\\'s standards, but not terrible), the scope of the project is momentous, and the romance is just as over-the-top to match. Had a lesser film tried to get away with some of the Jack-and- Rose cheesiness pulled here, it would have been a disaster. But for some reason, it just works in \"Titanic\" (again, I think because of the epic nature of the whole project).\\n\\nCameron also could not have picked a better setting for an epic. We are now over 100 years removed from the fateful sinking, yet it is an event that still carries a high level of fascination...the \"unsinkable ship\" sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic. I think Cameron also makes a great decision to go the high-drama route, as this easily could have been turned into an ultra-realistic pseudo-documentary of the event. I\\'m sure that (knowing Cameron\\'s style) much research was done to make things as accurate as possible, but the fictional presence of Jack and Rose adds that layer of high drama that turns the whole production into a prestige event.\\n\\nThe only reason I can\\'t give \"Titanic\" the full five stars? Well, there\\'s two, actually: First, Cameron really lays the \"class differences\" stuff on thick in the latter stages of the film. It is set up perfectly in the beginning, but as the film drew to a close I wanted to be enthralled by the sinking visuals or swept away in the sheer emotion, not be constantly beaten over the head with the \"first class are conniving snobs while third class are the unsung heroes\" trope. I know from \"Avatar\" that Cameron has little qualms about obviously sticking his own beliefs into films (and doing so quite heavily), so maybe that\\'s just par for the course for his films. Secondly, I honestly believe that better casting could potentially have been done with the Rose character. In no way do I wish to demean the talents of Kate Winslet, as I know she is a wonderful actress in her own right, but I never felt like she was right for this part. She is great as the uptight Rose, but I never really bought into her as the \"moon-eyed lover\" of Jack. It felt odd to me. Luckily, DiCaprio is a joy to behold on screen in the film, so some of the chemistry issues are solved by his sheer enthusiasm.\\n\\nI think that \"Titanic\" is one of those movies that got so big, so fast, that now its reputation proceeds it a bit. I found a similar thing happened to the film \"Dead Poet\\'s Society\". Whereas now standing up on a desk to make a point is \"old hat\", there was a time when it was truly riveting. That same logic must apply to \"Titanic\", too. Whether you are watching it for the first time or re-watching it for the umpteenth time, this is a flick where the slightest bit of cynicism can ruin the entire experience. You have to clear the slate of the mind every single time and enjoy the epic experience for what it is. If you can do that, \"Titanic\" is truly a treasure. This film focuses on the tragic first voyage of the British luxury steamer RMS Titanic, which sank in the North Atlantic. Directed and written by James Cameron, the film features Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The soundtrack, one of the most iconic of cinema, is James Horner.\\n\\nTitanic will always be the icon of the golden age of maritime passenger transport. The biggest of steamers, the most luxurious of luxury ships, it was the largest ship in the world at the time and it was said that it was unsinkable. Unfortunately, everything is made of iron can sink. The negligence of the responsible for the ship, which ignored all warnings of ice and never prepared it with enough lifeboats to all the people inside it, led to a huge and unnecessary tragedy.\\n\\nIn the midst of all, we have the unlikely love between Rose, a rich girl, and Jack, a young who grew up in the streets. It\\'s the classic clichÃ© \"rich girl loves poor boy\" or, in this case, \"adventurer, eager to make a fortune, loves rich and bored girl who wants to feel strong emotions\". Their story is similar to many others and, in addition to never be credible enough, it quickly becomes cloying and boringly predictable, and gives voice to the preconceived ideas of Cameron, showing social \"barriers\" rich/poor ( symbolized in the film by locked doors between the ship classes) as if they were divisions between good and bad. World is not so simple, so dark-and-gray, and divisions like that still exists today, in other ways.\\n\\nThe choice of the two main actors was excellent. Although still young and not well known, they have become stars. DiCaprio was the pretty face of the girl\\'s wet dreams for a long time thanks to this movie, and even had to take off the heartthrob image later to diversify his career. In fact, he is a talented actor, as Kate, and both worked well in the romantic scenes. The film also contains stunning scenes of the ship, whose interiors have been carefully re- created and then destroyed during the scene of the wreck. The details are excellent, they were in the collective memory for the quality that was achieved. Special and sound effects are also excellent. Everything about this movie it\\'s garbage . Inane ,dull or boring are too gentle words to describe how bad is this movie .\\n\\nI don\\'t care anything about all the hype that this movie receives ,or that it won the Academy Award of best movie (so what ? Many bad movies receive a lot of praise and prizes for the success that those movies have in the box office rather than in the real artistic value ) The acting it\\'s bad and all the story it\\'s a bad soap opera that uses history as a excuse to tell the story of all the days . Deep inside ,it\\'s just a glorified chick -flick . I\\'m not amazed that it was chosen to be part of the list \"100 years ,100 stinkers \" . \"Titanic it\\'s the most over rated garbage ever made .Zero stars . Titanic is a movie about a ship called Titanic and it takes place in 1912.Titanic leaves on a journey from England and is on the way to New York but it never gets there, because Titanic hits an iceberg and sinks.You all should know this story, because it happens to be a true story.But this movie tells also about two people falling in love in the ship.These two people are the rich Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Kate Winslet and The poor Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.And then there is also Rose\\'s angry boyfriend Cal Hockley,played by Billy Zane.Gloria Stuart plays the old Rose.So everything goes pretty fine before Titanic hits the iceberg. Titanic was pretty successful movie,according to all the Oscars it got.But was Titanic worth every Oscars?Not necessarily.The topic of the movie was good and it touched many of us but the love story in Titanic was pretty boring, only the rest part, when Titanic is sinking, is more absorbing.Too long this movie is, I could say.But this works pretty well, anyway. nan Not my favourite film by any stretch. It became a film much like Greencard that just became trendy to watch and like way beyond any actual evidence of being a great film.\\n\\nIt is waaay too long and surprisingly bland. It could be compared to the Poseidon Adventure, an epic ship sinking disaster movie, but it decided to focus on the love story of the two protagonists. For me that was a poor choice, it could have been a drama of high tension.\\n\\nBut no. Just the worlds longest romance novel. Disaster movies might be my favorite genre. There\\'s a simple formula to these movies: the first half hour is the set-up and then the roof caves in. Writer/director/producer James Cameron missed the memo. Cameron takes over an hour and a half to get to the meat and potatoes. It\\'s time wasted. The first half of \"Titanic\" is long and tedious. The bookend story isn\\'t that interesting. The voyage stuff is pure melodrama. The dialogue is corny with way too much \"explaining\". That stuff is informative but it never sounds real. For some reason the strong cast isn\\'t very good either. Overall, they get a grade of C+. It\\'s when \"Titanic\" hits the iceberg that the movie really comes alive. It\\'s exciting and very emotional. The last hour or so is classic. I saw \"Titanic\" twice in the theater. Once when it first came out and the other time was for its 3D re-release. I\\'ve also seen it a bunch of times at home (including tonight). I don\\'t watch it as often as I did because I\\'m starting to really dislike the first half. Dishonorable mention: Kate Winslet\\'s less than thrilling nude scene. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I went into the theater thinking \"this is going to be just another disaster movie\", but was totally bowled over by what I witnessed. As the huge liner was breaking apart, it was as though I were sitting in a smaller vessel nearby observing the entire ordeal. The camera work was as realistic as could be expected, the acting was very good, the script completely believable. It was the epitome of savage action, wondrous romance, and heartbreaking loss. This film will remain one of my all time favorites from now on. OK. Normally I would give this movie a 7/10 on the rating, but there are so many people who give this a high rating just because they are an idiot who focuses on one actor or one scene and claim that this movie deserves 10/10 or even a 9/10. No, it doesn\\'t. It is not perfect. It has bugs, flaws, mistakes and other issues. 8/10 max, but I prefer 7/10. However, I can\\'t give a 7/10 because of all the school girl mentality involved with the rating of this movie. Am I being childish? Maybe? But logical wins out and tells me that I must find balance in the Universe and to do that I must give a 1/10 to this movie.\\n\\nSo if you are interested, yes, then by all means, watch this movie, but when you review it don\\'t go all \"Leo!!!!\" and give 10/10 because your panties are all wet. I watched this movie on theaters 11 years ago, around December or January 1st. 1998, I can\\'t remember.\\n\\nAll I can remember is that everybody watched it twice or even more times on the theaters while it was enough for me to watch it once.\\n\\nThe plot is directed only for girls or guys who HAVE to go with their girlfriends in order to get laid or something.\\n\\nThe situations are romantic oriented and nothing more. The soundtrack is catchy but that\\'s it and the f/x are really spectacular but nothing you haven\\'t seen.\\n\\nStill, this is a perfect romantic movie that will have your girlfriend crying and hugging you.\\n\\nEverybody hates it because it\\'s filled with clichÃ©s but on it\\'s time it was extremely popular that everyone had to watch it to comment about it.\\n\\nNowadays, it\\'s just looks like a Hallmark production. It opens tense before Cameron imperceptibly removes that tension. Then the iceberg appears, & the film is full steam ahead. I\\'m an easy scare when it comes to the dangers of water, & when the lower decks begin filling with water, it\\'s terrifying. Then when the lights finally go out on the upturned ship...breathtaking. A corny & enormously effective reminder that even though money can give you power in countless ways, we\\'re all equal in the eyes of God and nature. What can be said about this film what wasent already been told,titanic is masterpiece in a filmaking and every scene is beautiful and made with a lot of skills,before rewatching this film i thought since it pased a lot of time since i watched titanic that this film is over hyped and overrated,but how wrong i was,leo and kate are iconic in this film and they had one of best chemistries ever put on screen,even minor characters in this film felt imprortant to plot and they put a mark on their characters,also this film is also sad i know that people consider that line cliched but it is true,titanic is defienetly one of most remarkable films of all time and also one of most hardest made and achivable in every ways of making it At first glance, Titanic is an epic film. The scenery and cinematogrpahy are spectacular, and it is just a beautifully photographed movie. However, when you look past the superficial beauty of the film, much like Armageddon, its numerous shortcomings become clear. First of all, Titanic suffered badly from the transition from the big screen to video. This took away a lot of the hugeness of the film, and this inadvertently places more attention on the story and the acting, both of which were the biggest problems with the film. I went to see this movie to see the sinking of the Titanic, not to see some elaborately fabricated love story.\\n\\nTitanic is a landmark film as a result of the sinking of the ship and the fact that it inexplicably turned out to be such a huge moneymaker. There is absolutely nothing great about the acting, the story is nothing that hasn\\'t been seen dozens of times before, and the directing is awkward, probably due to the fact that James Cameron, who is an excellent director, is so used to directing the Frankenstein-like Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. This is not to say that the directing was bad, it wasn\\'t at all, but there is nothing special to be said about the directing because James Cameron is not really a director of this type of film.\\n\\nKate Winslet was beautiful in Titanic. She delivered a wonderful performance in the film and was very convincing, as was Kathy Bates (as always) and even Billy Zane. I normally don\\'t like him, but he was playing a dislikeable character, which is probably why I enjoyed his performance so much. Leonardo DiCaprio, however, delivered the worst performance of his career. If you want to see him really act, watch The Basketball Diaries or, even better, The Beach.\\n\\nTitanic is a beautifully made film. It suffered in the story and the acting departments, but it is an entertaining and easy to watch movie. It was not, however, the best picture of 1997. Not even close. There were probably 20 movies that were released in 1997 that were better than Titanic, but the Oscar\\'s wouldn\\'t have gained as much public support had they not given the Oscar to Titanic. It was a quality film, but don\\'t be fooled by all of the hype. I, like many of my age, saw this when it originally aired as a class assignment. It had a great impact on me. The movie may not be the greatest ever made, but the acting is more than adequate, especially from Jason Robards, and the script was far better than any other movies made for television at that time. I recommend it to anyone, even those with a low tolerance for grossness (radiation sickness is shown in progressive stages, and it is not pretty). It\\'s dark, depressing, and if you get into it you will definitely need to follow it up with a musical or cartoons just to lift your spirits again. Still, the subject matter is not something that can be portrayed positively even at a tv-movie level of realism. nan nan nan Titanic was a pop culture phenomenon upon its release, breaking box-office and awards records. It obviously struck a chord.\\n\\nTitanic was an old-fashioned romance that happened to be made by a man who used revolutionary techniques. The first half of the film was about two star-crossed lovers from different strata and the second was about the disaster. The setting was used to look at the different attitudes about class and wealth as well as tell an emotional human story. Whilst scenes of the disaster supply lots of peril and excitement.\\n\\nEven though Titanic was a smash hit I doubt it made today because it was over three hours long and not based on a recognisable property. Studios want franchises and avoid making films over two and half hours. Big, grand, epic romance is a fictional but vivid and lavish telling of the maiden voyage of the doomed luxury liner. The story spotlights a youthful, star-crossed romance between a blue-collar American wanderer/artist (DiCaprio), and a pampered but open-hearted rich girl (Winslet) yearning to experience life. A long but truly breathtaking retelling of the grandest ship of its time is aided immeasurably by Cameron\\'s stellar direction and marvelous set design, made all the more believable by a superb cast and a finale that\\'s nothing short of remarkable. If you\\'re going to remake history, this is certainly a way to do it. A large-scale epic that actually delivers, one that will be remembered for years to come. ***Â½ nan nan It has now been five years since \"Titanic\" was released into theaters and broke box office records by taking in more than $500 million worldwide (due largely to teenage girls). The story soon became familiar to everyone: poor boy Leonardo DiCaprio falls in love with rich girl Kate Winslet. \"Titanic\" won eleven out of fourteen Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best director: James Cameron. This movie made Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet box office stars. Leonardo DiCaprio became the biggest teen heartthrob since Corey Feldman while Kate Winslet became the hottest woman in Hollywood. This for me, was most evident when these two kids in my sixth grade class made a wallpaper (it was non-nude) of her on the teacher\\'s computer.\\n\\nHowever, even with all the positive press this movie was getting, some people felt that \"Titanic\" was not all that it had been hyped up to be. Those people felt that \"Titanic\" was really nothing special, the acting especially that of Leonardo DiCaprio totally sucked, and some people claimed that the best part of this whole movie was when Kate Winslet stripped naked before having her youth immortalized as one of the girls in Jack\\'s book. Even after hearing all of these negative comments about this film, I did not let them have an impact on my viewing of it.\\n\\nFirst, I think we all have to remember that this movie is coming from James Cameron, the man who brought us \"The Terminator\", \"Aliens\", \"The Abyss\", produced \"Point Break\" and wrote \"Strange Days\", \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", \"True Lies\", and TV\\'s \"Dark Angel\". This movie made James Cameron probably one of the most successful directors in Hollywood. Even before \"Titanic,\" James Cameron had never ever really experienced that much success with any of his previous films.\\n\\nSecond, look at this film for what is, which is a fictional love story in a historical setting, not a historical romance.\\n\\nThird, this is the most expensive movie Hollywood has ever made, costing $200 million to make. Director James Cameron risked his entire career as well as sinking Paramount studios into bankruptcy. It was a VERY, VERY big gamble that fortunately for James Cameron and Paramount studios, would pay off.\\n\\nFourth, I\\'m a guy. I don\\'t care to see Leonardo DiCaprio and I didn\\'t watch this movie just to see Kate Winslet strip either, but I watched \"Titanic\" because I\\'m a fan of James Cameron and I have been since \"The Terminator\".\\n\\nFifth, I know that this is one of those movies that when there is a wide range of comments about it, that it is best view it for yourself and then make your own judgment. That being said, I\\'ve watched \"Titanic\" at least ten times since 1998 and I still don\\'t know whether or not I hate it or like it. But I give \"Titanic\" an eight out of ten based squarely on my own viewings and not popular opinion. Striking motion picture in every department, from the stunning visual effects right down to Gloria Stuart\\'s wonderful performance of an aged survivor of the 1912 disaster where over 1,500 lives were lost. Winner 11 Academy Awards, including the Best Picture of 1997. What else can be said...other than masterpiece! There are a ton of problems in \"Titanic\" â\\x80\\x93 the cartoon villains, the stilted dialog, much of it obviously re-recorded in post production. Some weak supporting performances, the betrayal of a number of historical facts, and taking what was already one of the most dramatic nights of the 20th century and needlessly pumping it up with chases, gunfire, theft, scheming, etc.\\n\\nYet a lot works. As much as I didn\\'t want to give in, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio make a great, old fashioned, star crossed romantic couple. Many of the effects and stunts are amazing (although at other times you realize some wide shots are basically giant video-game like cartoons). And it made me cry -- while I felt like a fool for being swept up in it\\'s shameless melodrama.\\n\\nI can\\'t argue that \"Titanic\" is art, or deep, or a great film, but I can say it\\'s a terrifically effective entertainment that everyone should see at least once. I think what I most admire about this film is how it is accessible to everyone. If you are interested in romance it has an earnest love triangle that is structured like a classic melodrama, i.e. Woman caught between the poor guy who represents liberation and the rich guy who represents safety. If you are interested in history it handles the Titanic story in a straight forward way and all the well known aspects are covered, i.e. The band playing during the sinking. If you are an action fan the actual sinking is quite impressive and engaging. If you are interested in cinematic techniques the film is a showcase of then cutting edge effects. And if you are so inclined to be snarky about any of that the film let\\'s you be with relative ease. None of these threads really dominate the film and Cameron does a great job balancing all of them. I don\\'t think everyone will like this film but I can\\'t imagine how somehow would utterly hate it; it is harmless and there are so many worse films to slag on..\\n\\nFor my money I rather enjoy the old fashioned spirit and how earnest the film is. Both because it is fun to be snarky about Jack and Rose. (JACK! ROSE!). But more often than not I rather get swept up in the melodrama. I utter aware of the writing issues and yet I still feel melancholy at the end of the film.\\n\\nOn my last re-watch I was struck by how well the special effects have stood up over time. There are shots/effects here and there that no longer work fully but on the whole the film presents the sinking and the like in a very believable way. Cameron does a great job of mixing up the illusions to make it all work.\\n\\nYes this is a middle brow film; but films that capture the industry\\'s attention and the public\\'s awe tend to be middlebrow. This is one of those movies where the cinematography is one of the main highlightes. The ship sinking is awesome and best seen in either the big screen or in widescreen format. That scene and the budding romance between Leo & kate make up the vast majority of this film-about 97% of it. The movie certainly made a heartthrob of Leo! See this movie if just for the ship sinking part. Young & the Restless fans can spot Eric Braeden (Victor) as John J. Astor, and of course Leo, Kate, and Kathy Bates (Molly Brown) are recognizable, as is Billy Zane.\\n\\n*** out of **** nan nan Titanic is a drama romantic movie directed by James Cameron and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, and Late Bill Paxton.\\n\\nTo be honest the movie is a milestone in the history of cinema and I am in no position to review this masterpiece.\\n\\nThis movie is been viewed by millions of people across the globe and the viewership must be in billions but still whenever you see the movie it feels fresh and refreshing.\\n\\nActing is great by the very young Kate and Leonardo. Billy Zane played a part so well that viewers start hating him whenever he appears onscreen. Kathy in the role of a softhearted rich women and Fisher in the role of a woman showcasing her false pride is effective.\\n\\nScreenplay is good and gripping although gets little slow in between but still it will not make you feel that the length of the movie. Cinematography is wonderful. Climax is beautifully shot and is emotional.\\n\\nOverall this is one of the most beautiful romantic movies made in the history. The movie that will stand the test of time and one of the stellar best of the 20th century.\\n\\nThe movie that brought tears to my eyes and took my breath away in the theaters, watching it once, not having enough of it and returning two days later to watch it again with the same awe on my face and emotions down my throat.\\n\\nThe movie which screenplay, acting, development, flow and score were magical, right like from a fairytale.\\n\\nThe movie where romantic and grumpy people alike gasped for air, blushed with tight lips and eyes down, were bewildered with mouths half-open, shedding drops of tears, while some wholeheartedly cried, feeling its ravishing, sensitive, sensual flow and the catastrophic end of it with all their body and mind.\\n\\nAnd the movie that will never cease to amaze me, one that I will never forget and the one so dear to my romantic heart.\\n\\nJack and Rose were young, gorgeous and breathtaking, symbols of a long lost and tragic love, the history of which was made possible by James Cameron\\'s elastic mind, keen eyes and dexterous hands.\\n\\nKudos to all of you involved! You deserve all the fame and success that you\\'ve earned. Titanic is a staggeringly expensive and elegant love story, set against one of the most shocking maritime tragedies in history. Prior to its release, the media had their knives out for director James Cameron and were poised like vultures to cut him down to size. The budget had spiralled out-of-control, the film was scheduled with a running time of 3 hours, and everyone predicted a critical and financial disaster of unprecedented magnitude. As it turns out, Titanic is actually a good film. Not an excellent film, which many people seem to suggest, but definitely a good film. The second half in particular, which deals with the sinking of the ship and the chaos and panic that sweeps through the passengers, is very well made cinema.\\n\\nIn the present, treasure hunters discover aboard the wreckage of the Titanic a drawing of a naked woman wearing a priceless diamond necklace. An old lady named Rose (Gloria Grahame) sees the drawing on the TV news. She calls in immediately, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. Rose is flown out to the dive centre in the Atlantic, where she narrates the story of how she came to be the subject of the drawing. She tells how a penniless American youth, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), won a ticket onto the Titanic during a card game in Southampton. She tells how she as a young woman (Kate Winslet) was travelling in first-class with her fiancÃ©e, banker Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), and how the two of them were unhappy in their relationship. Gradually, Jack - an aspiring artist - and Rose came together and began to fall in love. Then, the unthinkable happened and the Titanic hit an iceberg....\\n\\nFor 90 minutes or so, Titanic almost lives down to the disastrous reputation that had been predicted of it before its release. It is a naive, slushy romantic story in which the love affair that develops is unconvincing and unbelievable. The characters of Rose, Jack and Cal are lifted straight from the pages of a Barbara Cartland-style, clichÃ©d love-and-passion romance. But the film dramatically improves once the iceberg strikes. Cameron is into more comfortable territory at this point, showing his dazzling technical talents and his mastery of spectacle and excitement in a prolonged sinking sequence of true quality. The film suddenly becomes more purposeful and urgent, more exciting and moving. For upwards of an hour, we witness an authentic and harrowing event from a perspective of remarkable realism.\\n\\nTitanic eventually emerged as a phenomenally successful film, and recouped all its budgetary outlay plus a whole lot more. It also made the critics eat the words of their negative predictions. Yes, the opening stretch isn\\'t up to much..... but the ship-sinking sequence more than compensates, and transforms this into a very commendable film. The film starts with the search for a valuable diamond that is presumed to have been lost when the Titanic sank. An old survivor, Rose (Gloria Stuart) contacts the team who are searching through the Titanic on the ocean-bed. She sits down and recounts her memories of the journey that she had and the love that she found with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio)........oh yeah...........the ship sinks........\\n\\nI began watching the film determined not to cry but it all got too much and I started to well up as the credits started and the film began! Although, I think it\\'s a good film, I feel I should mention the following points. Its way too long - scenes are drawn out and this had the effect of detaching me from the action and so lessening my emotional involvement. I thought that Kate Winslet as \"Rose\" and Leonardo DiCaprio were good in the lead roles but Kate was too much of a woman. She is meant to be a 16 year old. She was far too mature. This made Jack seem a bit too boyish for her, although his look is probably right considering that Kate is meant to be 16. Having said that, Winslet\\'s facial expressions are very good and she draws you in to what she is feeling - she conveys the despair of the situation very well. She\\'s also pretty good with an axe! I felt that DiCaprio was likable despite his constant optimism and the rest of the cast were good.\\n\\nThank goodness that the Titanic sank and gave us such a wonderful tragedy. 1st watched 8/6/1998 - 10 out of 10(Dir-James Cameron): Excellent big movie, for a big event involving a big boat with directing of Titanic proportions(stop me please!!). Tremendous detail on Titanic\\'s sinking with a believable love story attached. I went to see \"Titanic\" for Leonardo DeCaprio - so what? (Heck I\\'d already seen Kate Winslet naked in \"Jude.\" What - so guys don\\'t go to the movies to see a certain \"Pretty Woman\"?\\n\\nBut it was inappropriate that people brought kids, what with kids talking and asking questions through the whole movie and the parents commenting back. This is a big Hollywood extravaganza but it doesn\\'t mean that kids should be there as if it were \"Men in Black.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s selling out every showing in my neighborhood. So it\\'s the most expensive movie ever made. It\\'s what Hollywood is good at regardless of where it was filmed and what other things could be achieved in this world with all that money.\\n\\n(originally written 1/4/1998) Wow! Leonardo and Kate really shine as a starving artist and a beautiful rich girl! I thought that Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) looked very beautiful in the dress she wore when she first met Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio). The one person I really couldn\\'t stand was Cal (Billy Zane). This was because he was very conceited, arrogant, and controlling of the woman he loved. Plus, he chased after Jack and Rose, attempting to kill them. If I were Rose, I would have told Cal that the wedding\\'s off. Other than that, this film really touched me and made me feel good. In conclusion, to all you Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet fans who haven\\'t seen TITANIC, go to the video store, buy it or rent it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. I guarantee you you\\'ll enjoy it, or your money back. Titanic is for sure one of the most beloved films ever made, especially by the Academy in the year it came out. I believe it is very deserving of the many praises it has received over the years. i know there are people that claim it\\'s terrible and i think it\\'s mostly guys who roll their eyes at the romance involved.\\n\\nOk so i think the acting from the very talented cast is well done. Winslet and DiCaprio are both doing their absolute best here, which is great because they really are two very gifted actors. i believe their love story because of the chemistry between them. I think the drawing scene and the car scene are both very beautifully done, handled well. The expressions on their faces portray real love and affection, but they both at the same time show a sense of vulnerability too. The other actors are very convincing as well, one that deserves praise is Kathy Bates, who plays Molly Brown. She had a great, believable energy about her, and she provides some fun comedic relief too. Gloria Stuart is so amazing here, she might be my favorite member of the cast, it may be a tie between her and DiCaprio because they\\'re both so great.\\n\\nThe visual effects in this film are just flat out incredible! They still hold up today and they are so realistic and breathtaking to watch. The soundtrack is great and I think it fits the film\\'s tone. Overall, James Cameron knows what he\\'s doing and he has people around him who also know what they\\'re doing, so it results in a wildly entertaining, smart film, one that I will forever call a masterpiece. Phenomenal film. The thematically rich epic love story that never gets old and still one of the highest hollywood achievements of all time. nan The famous story of the Titanic is told.\\n\\nSo much has been said about this movie, what can I add? I guess the first thing that springs to mind is the timeless appeal of the film. When I saw it a few times in 1997 there was question in my mind about the timeless element of the flick...would I still love it so much 20 (or 19) years later? Well guess what, I do.\\n\\nIn fact, in some ways I like it even more now. Since 1997 has there been a movie where the production crew have actually built large sections of a massive ship just for a movie? And what about the wonderful musical score! Do we get scores like that today?\\n\\nTitanic is a movie everybody must see before they die as I don\\'t think Hollywood will ever make a movie like this again. 15 years after this classic first hit, it\\'s back, and now it looks and sounds better than ever, and some recent releases look so muddy and artificial in comparison. Here Cameron uses his expertise to improve on the technical aspects of \"Titanic\" without sacrificing what already worked. Nothing gratuitously calls attention to the new \"3D\" transfer. Instead, it enhances the gorgeous and meticulously produced movie. The spectacle glows with renewed strength, and each performance, each costume, each set now looks remarkable, all contributing what a true cinematic experience should be.\\n\\nAs everyone knows, our stars are not reciting Shakespeare. The focus is on the relationship, and how two young people connect with each other. Surrounding them is cast of real and fictional character that gives us a little insight into what it was like being in the doomed ship. People look and act the part. Each class defined by the parameters of their own creation. Cameron understands the passengers on this ride. Zane, Bates, De Caprio and Winslet all do remarkable work, and it\\'s still a question why De Caprio wasn\\'t recognized by his peers when the film first came out. He is central to the success of this confection.\\n\\nIn the end, the film, like the title will go on, having us choke on the emotional highs, the times when we understand what gives us humanity and hope, and when we see that humans share so much and are so far from perfect, but we just keep on going, and we will have dreams even after the worst of nightmares.\\n\\nIt deserves repeated viewings and much praise. Thank you, Mr. Cameron. Titanic opened on the day of birth, and my birthdays have progressively gotten worse since that day. To me, Titanic presents a myriad of raw anger and spite. I could bash this movie for years. and my insults would never cease. From the improbable story line, to the putrid acting performance by Leo has made this movie a bane of existence.\\n\\nOne would say I\\'m nothing but a bitter person, but such insinuations could be further from the truth. If I had enough guts, I would burn every last print in existence. No one is going to remember this film except for the fact they spent 20 bucks to buy a crummy movie which has spurned equally dull films of the same formula (the Green Mile, Pearl Harbor, and many more to come).\\n\\nI just have one big question for all of the idiots who voted for the Academy Awards for the year 1997. What were you thinking?!! How could you not choose L.A. Confidential or Good Will Hunting. Another reason why the Oscars will always disappoint me. I will say this: The Lord of the Rings opened on my birthday as well (hopefully, the curse is broken) This movie re-wrote film history in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I\\'ve seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages. To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that\\'s your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90\\'s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done. I\\'ve seen quite a lot of movies in my life, but \"Titanic\" stands alone. It is the most amazing, beautiful, heartbreaking movie ever made. The final scene broke my heart into a thousand pieces. I love this movie very much and always will. All of the critics for \"Titanic\" should really be on line for the new Star Wars, right?\\n\\nThe extent of critcism for \"Titanic\", even at this late date, indicates that even those who hate it are still thinking about it and want to bash in it light of the new George Lucas movie.\\n\\n\"Titanic\" has a solid place in movie history, with movie fans everywhere in the world, and a couple of bored and angry people are not going to change that. I love the movie and I always will. So, bit of backstory for me and this movie. When I was but a wee moviegoer my birthday came around and there were two big movies playing: Titanic and Flubber. At that age? I wanted to see Flubber, hands down, no question. We saw Titanic. Ever since then, I\\'ve had something of an unfair distaste for this one but recently I thought, \"It\\'s been years, Cameron made it... I need to give it a fair chance.\"\\n\\nWell, I can comfortably say that while I don\\'t think it\\'s for me, I was unfair to this as a child. It really lives up to the Cameron pedigree of being just absolutely gorgeous. The way he made that ship feel, the size of it, the grandeur is just the kind of master craft we come to expect of the man. The cast deliver solid performances throughout, there\\'s a proper sense of drama, even though we all know how it\\'s going to play out.\\n\\nWhere it loses me is in the over-the-top nature of the love story. It feels like he\\'s going for a Shakespearean, Romeo and Juliet type of romance epic and I just can\\'t help but feel it\\'s over the top. Beyond that, I could really do without the whole modern aspect of the story. I just feel like it slows stuff down and doesn\\'t really bring anything to the story.\\n\\nWhelp, child me was wrong. This is a pretty solid movie, stunning to look at but is a little too cloying for my tastes still. I will no longer actively avoid it, won\\'t flip the channel if it happens to be on. Can\\'t say I\\'ll be seeking it out again anytime soon, but who knows. It\\'s sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichÃ©d and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it\\'s of that awkward age where it\\'s too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.\\n\\nHistorical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized. And I\\'m not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.\\n\\nCameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn\\'t faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship\\'s sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron\\'s greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay\\'s guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.\\n\\nThe studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as the when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all it\\'s moments like this where a performance counts the most. But what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness, and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevant.\\n\\nThis diamond of a movie is not, I\\'ll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious \\'90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well, because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it really is everything a movie should be. nan nan First of all, `Titanic\\' was, on the whole and all things considered, a good movie. There have been much sillier Best Picture awards handed out over the years. I\\'ll go through the basic drill as quickly as possible ... Yes, the Titanic was HUGE - Titanic, as they say - and astounding to watch; yes, the musical score was intolerable, synthesised, neo-Celtic syrup; yes, Kate Winslet was gorgeous and, at one point, naked; yes, the story was pleasant, but pretty thin for three hours. Have I covered everything? Probably not, but I want to move on to complain about the very end. The final few minutes contain footage that is just so manifestly stupid, so completely unnecessary, so obviously witless, that even if it\\'s not enough to ruin the movie, James Cameron ought never be allowed to hear the end of it. The trouble is that I can\\'t lodge my complaint without giving some stuff away. So I feel obliged to issue a\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nto those people, wherever they may be, who have not yet seen `Titanic\\' - which I hope they will ignore. Go on. Have a peek. It can\\'t REALLY hurt you to know what you\\'re in for. It\\'s not me, but James Cameron, who wants to lull you into quiescence for three hours and then hit you over the head with a big stupid mackerel. -That said, I\\'ll issue a\\n\\nSECOND WARNING\\n\\nbefore getting down to business.\\n\\nMy complaint is in two parts:\\n\\n(1) A good deal of interest was supplied as we watched the diamond change hands throughout the movie, wondering where it would end up when the ship finally sank. Well, it ends up - this is your last chance to stop reading - in Rose\\'s hands. She keeps it. In fact she has it on her person seventy-something years later when she heads out into the Atlantic to meet the salvagers. Then she wanders out to the railing one night and tosses it into the ocean. WHY toss it into the ocean? If she doesn\\'t need the money, then the poor sods who invested heavily in order to find the diamond probably do - why not give THEM the diamond? And what RIGHT does she have to effectively destroy this historical heirloom, former property of Louis XIV? Clearly Cameron thought that, having made such heavy weather of the diamond early on, he needed to do something with it at the end, and he thought that throwing it into the sea would be very fine and dramatic. Dramatic fiddlesticks.\\n\\n(2) Rose finally dies at a ripe old age and goes to a kind of heavenly Titanic where she is re-united with her true love, Jack. But hang on. She\\'s been married for several DECADES to some other bloke, who presumably has SOME claim on her affections in the afterlife. I bet there\\'ll be an awkward moment on the HMS Celestial Titanic when HE shows up. But over-glorifying her (no doubt genuine) love for Jack is the least of it. Why the sudden dive into the supernatural? One minute, we\\'re in the material universe with the rest of the human race; the next, we\\'re up in the sky somewhere. I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t give us a shot of Cal Hockley stoking the boilers in Hell. (I\\'ve heard some people run the defence that this is all just a dream. This strikes me as a strained interpretation; and even if it\\'s the right interpretation, it\\'s a poor defence. Dreams are dramatically irrelevant. At least, this one is.)\\n\\nThese two complaints aren\\'t trivial: they\\'re illustrative of a more general problem. The wondrous spectacle of `Titanic\\' is more than twice undercut by Cameron\\'s facile theatrics. Still - big ship, adolescent love, Kate Winslet, lots of water, and all that. Big Sinking Boat is a great movie. I saw it 3 days after it came out, and couldn\\'t believe how well it was made; the scenes on the bow(I\\'m Flying!) as the boat chugs into the sunset probably what helped put the film over for me as much as anything. What puts Titanic up there with the other great epics-Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, etc. is that Cameron knew, KNEW that to get you hooked, he needed characters people cared about, Felt for, and wanted to see more of.\\n\\nThe movie has heart, excellant performances, the best of FX; it pulls you into its world and doesn\\'t let go until it wants to. Wrap that up with the most haunting theme music this side of Field of dreams....is it any wonder it made so much $$$ in \\'97-98? A deserved Oscar winner, an old fashioned epic done the right way for once.\\n\\n**** outta **** of course. nan nan Titanic, newly released from Paramount Pictures on Blu-ray3D and digital, didn\\'t completely sweep the Academy Awards in 1998 â\\x80\\x93 it only took 11 of the Oscar statuettes! Among them: Best Picture, a Best Director for James Cameron and a Best Cinematography for Russell Carpenter. Some of that sweeping cinematography is bound to be lost on a home screen, but home surround-sound can do a nice job on its Oscar- winning Best Sound. Seasoned KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Raven Devanney, age 15, calls Titanic a \"romantic masterpiece.\" The film evokes strong emotion partly because of the real-life tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life. That the film is 15 years old does not diminish its impact. Says Raven, \"Â\\x85 even though I\\'ve seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up.\" On a scale of one to five, she rates it a five only because higher numbers aren\\'t available.\\n\\nTitanic\\n\\nReviewed by Raven Devanney See her full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huGlaj1F_d0 Titanic is my favorite movie by far. This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy. I remember the first time I watched Titanic. I was 7 years old, and I\\'ve been hooked ever since. This was the first film that really made me cry, and even though I\\'ve seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up. This movie is beautifully done. I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997. I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory. I\\'m a total history geek when it comes to the Titanic. I\\'ve seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool. My favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course! They defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love. Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles. I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene. It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny. Plus, you almost get a mini tour of the ship. I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking. The way it is captured is amazing. It\\'s the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way. Like I said, this film is very tragic, and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad. I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate. I watched it when I was 7 and nothing bothered me. This is a must-see movie, and I give it five out of five stars. I\\'d give it more if I could! Titanic is in stores now on DVD and Blu-ray, so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today! Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless. nan nan nan This film is about Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich girl, and Jack Dawson, a poor boy who both fall in love on the ship, Titanic, in which it sank in 1912.\\n\\nThis is a very wonderful film with great romance and peril. The special effects are terrific in the film. It\\'s top notch with the action scenes and keeps the suspense going on the film. Well, that\\'s the second half of the film.\\n\\nThe first half is a great romance. We see Rose when she old (obviously, she survived) and she\\'s telling the tale to ones who want to seek treasure in the ship. They don\\'t believe her but as she tells the story, they do.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t some of the millions who have seen this movie in the theater because I was practically five and there was no way that I would recognize this film. Now that I\\'ve finally seen the whole film, I\\'ve always seen the ending but never the whole movie, I loved it. I thought the first hour was going to be a waste because I don\\'t imagine a film going 3 hours long unless the sinking occurs in the end but it occurred in the second half of the film.\\n\\nThe acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great. they have great chemistry in the film and others like Billy Zane and Kathy Bates are good too.\\n\\nThis is one of the best films ever. It has great action scenes and is a great tale of romance and should be seen by people who likes watching movies. It\\'s not too hard to figure out what kept audiences flocking to \"Titanic\" when it came out. The sheer spectacle of it as well as the sweeping sense of romance which Cameron succeeds in evoking made this a \\'must-see\\' theatrical experience. At the time and even for a while after, \"Titanic\" seemed like it would go down as an epic for the ages, a masterpiece with the overwhelming reputation of classic epics like \"Gone With the Wind\". The Oscar wins seemed to cement that.\\n\\nThen came the backlash, which was inevitable for any film with this sort of popularity. The thing is, \"Titanic\", to some extent, deserved its backlash. It is obviously nowhere near as bad as some say, but viewed today, 12 years later, in a home setting away from the \\'theatrical experience\\' many enjoyed back then, the movie\\'s flaws are easily exposed. The screenplay is really not strong at all, the characters are more like caricatures, and the romance not particularly convincing. At most, during the excruciatingly long hour and some spent on set-up, this romance which Cameron seems to think is the epitome of romantic cinema, a love affair to match the scope of the film, seems like a cute fling. Jim Cameron\\'s knack for writing some truly execrable dialogue is not gone just yet, and while I can knock back a beer or two (or seven) and watch Ripley lay waste to xenomorph after xenomorph in \"Aliens\" while cracking one-liners, it\\'s a little hard to take in this setting. Still, most of the dialogue is solid or average, and there are some good lines. The narrative structure and momentum is nothing special at all- poor dude meets rich girl, they \\'fall in love\\', Titanic hits the iceberg and then there\\'s an hour of running here and there and special effects.\\n\\nSo the film was over-hyped, yes. Jim Cameron\\'s previous films were all better, bar \"True Lies\" and his cheap debut feature \"Piranha 2\", but that doesn\\'t mean \"Titanic\" doesn\\'t have its positive points. It is obviously a wonderful technical achievement that still stands tall, is very nicely-shot, and there are a number of excellent scenes. Indeed, the sheer spectacle of the final hour and some, from the moment the ship hits that iceberg, is still easy to get carried away by, and Cameron proves that he is more than capable as a popcorn entertainer. DiCaprio is very charming and proves himself as a dramatic actor in the latter stages while Winslet does her typically annoying nonsense, but on the negative side Horner\\'s score is pretty mediocre.\\n\\nIt\\'s a good enough film, over-hyped yes but that is the fault of the public, not the film, which remains flawed but ultimately fairly enjoyable, on par or better than most big budget flicks and disaster movies, but it\\'s no masterpiece, and now excuse me, I\\'m going to watch \"Aliens\" again. nan Thank you very much for all the staff for this unforgettable and very special movie. Director James Cameron delivers an example how a deep and perfect developed story takes your breath away with high emotional elements. It\\'s not the usual love romance film but it has some of its magic moments. At the end I couldn\\'t avoid tears in my eyes and wished really another end. Leonardo Di Caprio will remain for ever in my heart with the sweet soundtrack and I don\\'t understand why he didn\\'t get the Oscar for his outstanding performance. Anyway, Di Caprio counts no doubt as one of the best actors in the present. At least TITANIC won 11 Oscars and I am not surprised because everything is perfect. The scenery on the Titanic was wonderful done and the special effects were great. The DVD will take a great place in my best of DVD collection. My wife and me rate a solid 8/10. A must see for every cinema fan. nan If you watched this movie on blueray you know why I give it 5star Released around the Christmas season of 1997,this was an epic scale of a motion picture event. Director James Cameron\\'s three hour mega-budget picture has its brushes with disaster with a mammoth budget(which at the time this picture was made,it took two years to make and was the most expensive movie ever made at $285 million,the most costliest movie to date)and a theatrical release that seemed unattainable. But instead of reaping hordes of criticism for what many have thought was one of the biggest joke in Hollywood,Cameron received accumlated praise and a boatload of Oscar hardware for his labor of love,which rack up the Academy Awards with 11 Oscars including Best Picture,and has tied the record with \"Ben Hur\",and most recently the Lord Of The Rings final installment to the trilogy,\"The Return Of The King\",as the most record number of Oscars to be presented in Hollywood.\\n\\nThis was indeed,\"Gone With The Wind\" on an epic scale.\\n\\nThis was in fact a grand love story that happens to have the sinking of an historic ship as a backdrop,real characters and fictional characters are blended for a detailed re-enactment of the luxury liner\\'s first and last voyage. The main characters,two lovebirds Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio),and debutante Rose Bukater(Kate Winslet)are from different ends of the economic and social ladder. DiCaprio and Winslet are dynamic as the star-crossed lovers and make the running time of 198 minutes less a chore to sit through. The special effects are impressive with a life sized version of the ship just built for the film. Cameron\\'s prowess as a storyteller keeps the outcome of the ship suspenseful and tense even though the ending is no secret. The film contains an all-star cast including Billy Zane,Bill Paxton,Kathy Bates,Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart(in her final film role),Jonathan Hyde-White,Danny Nicci, Bernard Hill,Victor Garber,Bernard Fox,Suzy Amis,and David Warner.\\n\\nThe film has won numerous awards since its release and in 1997,it was the first film to win both the MTV Awards,Golden Globes and Oscars in that same year,not to mention Best Musical Score from composer James Horner and Best Song of that year,\"My Heart Will Go On\" sung by Celine Dion. Also to point,during its release,\"Titanic\" went on to break box office records,and it did just that but dethroning the all-time box office champ,\"Star Wars\",not to mention other box-office records as well including \"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\",\"ET\",and others at the time of its release,since then that record has been shattered by the most recent \"Lord Of The Rings\" trilogy and the \"Harry Potter\" series.\\n\\nReleased by two major Hollywood studios,Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century-Fox,the film itself has become one of the spectacular Hollywood greats. A grand classic.\\n\\nMPAA Rating:\"PG-13\"-For Brief Nudity,Action/Adventure Situations including Peril,Violence,and Brief Language. nan This is much better than word of mouth led me to believe. Of course the script is corny and full of simplistic sentiment and it panders shamelessly to mid-brow sensitivities, and there\\'s no question that the main intent is to jerk mass tears (but we could have guessed that from the subject). Still the photography is wonderful, Kate Winslet is captivating, and the plot clever. This is an old time Hollywood movie made not only to seduce the audience, but the Academy as well. And it succeeds.\\n\\nBilly Zane is perfectly one-dimensional and completely familiar as the conceited and selfish, immoral heir to a Gilded Age fortune. Kate Winslet as his intended is a ravishing beauty with oomph and a mind of her own. Leonardo DiCaprio as the wily and clever sketch artist who seduces her while twice saving her life comes across curiously as part Huck Finn and part John Boy. His romantic bravado in the freezing water saying he was so lucky to have won the steamship ticket because it allowed him to meet her was enough to embarrass even the most hardened Harlequin novelist.\\n\\nMost of the action before the bow scene was almost painful because just about every line was written so that a ten-year-old could understand what he was supposed to feel about whom. Evil, decadent rich people. Good, clever, hard working poor people. (They even party better.) ClichÃ© followed clichÃ©.\\n\\nBut the romantic bow scene was artfully staged, and after that Kate came to life. It was strange to see her in the early scenes. She seemed almost a bad actress, as though the mediocrity of the direction had reduced her. But her part was so big and she had so much to do that her natural talent overcame the early junior high school text and the later schmaltz.\\n\\nSince the audience knows the ending, Director James Cameron knew he had a fine opportunity for dramatic irony, but his touch was a bit heavy handed, e.g., as they\\'re boarding, a guy says, \"We\\'re the luckiest sons of bitches in the world.\" And since the audience knows eighty-five years of history unknown to the Titanic passengers, we get these further heavy bits of irony: On Picasso: \"He won\\'t amount to a thing. Trust me.\" And \"Freud, who is he?\\n\\nIs he a passenger?\"\\n\\nMy sensitivities were most offended, however, when Cameron has the savage crew smugly celebrate their good fortune before the safe they have hauled up is actually opened. That was the tip off for everybody in the audience to wisely know there would be little of value in the safe. Duh. In real life those guys don\\'t celebrate until the gold is in the hand. Cameron\\'s style is to flatter the audience, make them think they\\'re smart, the usual pandering of a mediocre talent. Cameron even tries his hand at some cheap symbolism, i.e., mommie tells Rose that she must marry this suffocating and insufferable man because they need the money as she vigorously tightens Rose\\'s confining corset.\\n\\nAll right. Why did the Academy vote this best picture? Simply because it was a popular lavish production squarely in the Hollywood tradition, employing a whole bunch of movie folk, and it was a financial success, just what the industry craves. I should add that everything technical in the film was excellent, and Cameron\\'s dramatic direction was a lot better than his dialogue. Also, because of the exquisite detail, watching the big ship sink was a whole lot of fun.\\n\\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can\\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!) It\\'s strange, I really liked this movie BEFORE Leonardo because famous. Now that he\\'s famous and hanging out at all the local hangouts in Hollywood and causing trouble, it\\'s thwarted my opinion of his acting skills. I will review this movie as if I saw it without knowing about Leo. Ok, it was great. I loved the scenes and the character portrayed by Billy Zane (who people say I look like) was perfectly evil. I have seen lots of movies which involve love but this movie happened to really capture the intensity of love that exists between Kate Winslet and Leo. I admit, the scene in the car was goofy. But the scene in the dining room was splendid. I hated the part where Leo screams that he\\'s the king of the world. Movies like this and Saving Private Ryan make us so much more interested in History. I agree that this movie was good. But heck, I just love history movies. Three thumbs up! Very beautiful and cinematic movie with lots of classic scenes.Also extremely sad at times.Absolute 90\\'s classic. OK, so the script is weak. OK, so the two leads are acknowledged as being very good looking. Do these two points detract from the overall quality of the film? Not really.\\n\\nBeing an aspiring screenwriter myself, I am usually the first to complain if the script is packed with corny lines. However, I class James Cameron as a maker of \\'Event\\' movies, and for the purpose of big budget blockbusters all that really matters is that the script pushes all the right emotional buttons. This one does. Despite not being a consummate wordsmith, Jim knows how to manipulate an audience so that they\\'re cryin\\' at the soppy parts and gaspin\\' at the thrilling bits. So, in that sense, any minor script faults don\\'t really come into it.\\n\\nWhat people also forget is that both Leo & Kate are actually good performers. Before this, Kate cut her acting teeth in weighty period adaptations like \"Jude\", and Leo did a good job of bringing his interpretation of one of the Bard\\'s classic characters to the big screen.\\n\\nThis is, as I\\'ve said, an event movie, and they don\\'t come much bigger in scale or scope. This is a good drama romance movie. Leo does really good. Winslet does good too as the rich spoiled girl. Why didn\\'t they both just stay on the ice? And why did she let go?\\n\\nWeird ending, good movie. I liked Leo\\'s performance, it set him up as the cool lead character for years to come.\\n\\n7 stars nan A romantic love happens between a reckless poor artist guy and a rich girl who is just engaged with her uncle...unfortunately a ship started to drown after hitted with big ice rocks... Every people started to escape from that ship to life saver boat..finally lot of peoples died and that protogonist guy save her gf .. Looks soo simple story like survival romance genre..but it doesnt.. Worth more oscars for this movie.. Excellent photography, script and dialogue and stunts and music.. All characters are acted soo well.. We couldnt skip any scene until the end.. This movie is my all time favorite..!! Some time ago I watched \"A night to remember\" (1958, Roy Ward Baker), a film about the Titanic. This film was the direct cause to rewatch the \"ultimate\" Titanic movie of James Cameron.\\n\\nBoth films tell of course the same story and share a number of comparable scenes (there is a you tube item where this comparison is acually made) and nonetheless the atmposhere is remarkably different. This difference is of course attributable to the romance between Rose (first class passenger played by Kate Winslet) and Jack (third class passenger played by Leonardo DiCaprio).\\n\\nThrough this romance Cameron is able to sketch class distinctions well before the scenes in which third class passangers are denied access to the lifeboats. The distinction is most visible in the scenes in which Jack fist dines with Rose in the first class and Rose thereafter visits the dance evening in the third class.\\n\\nCameron not only shows the distinction he also makes a value judgement. The first class passengers are (in majority) bad and hypocrite, the third class is on the contrary good, honest and full of life. This value judgement maybe somewhat generalising (for example the first class passenger Molly Brown (an excellent role of Kathy Bates) is rather sympathetic) but fits into the view in which the disaster with the Titanic is not just a \"traffic accident\" but symbolizes the decline of the 19th century class society and the end of the optimism at the start of the 20th century. In this symbolic view the iceberg stands for World War I.\\n\\nIn some ways the romance between Jack and Rose is overdone. Especially Jack is too much a prince on too white a horse. In the aformentioned dinner scene he adapts remarkably well to the first class manners, while in the rest of the film Cameron stresses the unbridgeable gap between the classes. Apart from this Jack is also a capable artist, a sharp psychologist (he foresees what will happen if Rose stays with her rich but possessive fiancÃ©) and last but not least he knows exactly how the Titanic will collapse.\\n\\nNot only Jack but also the spectator knows exactly how the Titanic will collapse. Earlier in the film it was explained to the old Rose (Gloria Stuart) by a member of an expedition to the wreck of the Titanic. The romance between Jack and Rose resulted in a nude portrait of Rose and the discovery of this nude portait in a safe on the Titanic enabled Cameron to frame the story as an intelligent flashback (old Rose telling her story to the members of the crew of the expedition).\\n\\nOn second glance I realised how smart Cameron constructed his film. The romance between Jack and Rose as a vehicle to illustrate the class society. The explanation to old Rose about the collapse of the Titanic to also inform the spectator so that he can concentrate on the human drama in scenes to come. The use of the blue Danuba from Strauss (reminding of \"2001: A space odyssey\" (1968, Stanley Kubrick)) in the scene where the first class passengers elegantly walk towards their dining table. Only the computer animations of the overwiew shots of the Titanic slightly disappointed me. They were scarcely better than the 1953 overviews (or is that a compliment to \"A night to remember\"? ).\\n\\n\"Titanic\" has grown almost synonymous with Kate Winslet and Leonardi DiCaperio. Don\\'t forget however the supporting actresses. Kathy Bates is superb as Molly, a nouveau riche who mercilessly exposes the hypocrisy of her fellow first class passengers. Gloria Stuart, who was 86 at that time and whose performances date back to \"The old dark house\" (1932, James Whale) is a perfect old Rose. nan The film is wonderful, there is nothing more to say. La peliccola is on a different level compared to films of its kind, so much so that it has become a cult of romantic films. Titanic was a heart-warming true story that touches the chord of your heart and feel sympathize for those thousands of innocent people killed in one of the most horrifying accident. A young aspiring painter meets a high class rich girl on the deck of Titanic and falls in love with her. Unfortunately , their love story is short lived as they face off the ill-fated disaster when their ship struck the iceberg and slowly sinks in the sea. Reviewing Titanic would be a little absurd for me as this one is a masterpiece by legendary director , James Cameron. I just came back after watching the 3D version of the film and I felt that I\\'ve seen the flick for the first time even though I\\'ve seen it 14 years back when it broke all the records in domestic as well in international circuits. I have always been an immense admirer for Cameron\\'s work right from Terminator series till the visually enthralling Avatar. He not only gives his best shot but also works on the minute details to make his film a must watch. Similarly , he directed Titanic and gives a detailed level explanation of what really happened on the tragic night of 14th April , 1914. The screenplay and writing should be given full marks. The cinematography and art direction are grandeur giving a feeling of living Titanic through 194 mins. Background score by James Horner is so intriguing that it gels well with the mood of the film. Performances by Leanardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is worth mentioning. They were young and relatively new when they did the film but I must tell you , they were superb. Overall , very emotional and heart-touching film in every sense that has re-written the history and will be immensely liked by people of all ages. Watching it again after 14 years in 3D is liking icing on the cake. A masterpiece in deed !! Titanic is the second film to win 11 Oscars , before only Ben- Hur classic had this done, Titanic is a great movie , more will it deserved both Oscar ?, the film photography is beautiful , the costume is also good, the performances are very good, and the cast is good, the couple Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio works , the more the film has some unnecessary characters , the soundtrack of James Horner is excellent , and the script is well written , the film is too long has more three hours, and the pace leaves the film through tiring , the direction of Cameron is great , Titanic is a great film with good performances and a beautiful soundtrack, with a slow pace that leaves the tiresome film, I do not particularly give 11 Oscars I believe that the film deserved a maximum of 6 Oscars . Note 8.3 Yeah, you heard me. The worst Star Trek movie ever made is more fun to watch than this over rated piece of garbage. It is a disaster flick. Nothing more. Acting is horrible, with exception of Billy Zane who is able to do a decent job. The special effects are the only thing going for this film. I normally enjoy movies from James Cameron (Aliens, Terminator) but I found this to be horrible. And by the way, DiCaprio can\\'t act and that\\'s why he didn\\'t get an Oscar for this slop. Avoid this movie at all costs and go see with entertainment value. James Cameron, the director who brought us horror classics such as \"The Terminator\" and \"Aliens\" suddenly swings around and gives us what is definitely his greatest achievement yet, in a movie that is still quite violent, yet about the exact opposite of his previous films. A love story about two young people from essentially opposite sides of life meeting on board the ill-fated ship RMS Titanic.\\n\\nOur cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, who launched his career with this film. Academy Award nominee Kate Winslet, along with Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, David Warner, Billy Zane, and numerous others star in this expansive film that covers nearly every historical detail that is not part of the fictional love story. DiCaprio did very fine in his role, along with Winslet. Gloria Stuart was also very good in her role, though it was a small one.\\n\\nLike all love stories, the film includes romantic scenes which are in my opinion, some of the best produced in film history. We become emotionally attached to the two main characters as they struggle to hold onto each other through the huge disaster the Titanic makes its destructive collision against the iceberg.\\n\\n\"Titanic\" made several achievements when it was released. It grossed over a billion dollars and is the highest grossing motion picture worldwide of all time. It also won eleven Academy Awards, one of only three films to do so. It launched the career of Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. And it is a very good love story. Unfortunately, it is also a movie that a large portion of the crowd hates. It\\'s 7.0 rating on IMDb is unfair. True, it\\'s a three-hour wait to the credits, but I never looked at my watch. Warning: may be some small spoilers.\\n\\nI have always been a James Cameron fan. He is really one of the only directors I can say that has never made a bad film. Even his Piranha 2 was humorous and a fine effort coming from such a young director with a small budget. He has made, from what I can recall, two masterpieces (Aliens and Terminator 2) a genre pioneer (Terminator) and one of the best action movies to come out in the 90\\'s ( True Lies ) and an ambitious touching film ( The Abyss ). But now he has outdone himself with Titanic. I don\\'t think there has ever been a film that has taken me through such a wide array of emotions as this one. And that is all attributed to Cameron. He wrote, produced and directed this film. And it is one of the best films ever made.\\n\\nWe all know the story of Titanic. A great ship sets sail for the U.S. from the U.K. and along the way it sinks and many people lost their lives in the Atlantic somewhere near Newfoundland. So there is no need to retell those events documentary style. A Night To Remember is there for that purpose. So what Cameron\\'s Titanic does is tells the tale of fictitious characters blended in with real ones amidst the real events of the sinking. And it not only makes the film entertaining, it shows the sheer horror of what happened that night and makes you more sympathetic to the characters because you spend three hours with them. This is a brilliant, brilliant film.\\n\\nTo start with, the actors are perfect. Not just DiCaprio and Winslet, but everyone from Zane and Bates right down to Paxton as the present day treasure hunter. But it is Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that are the true stars here as it the two of them that have to carry the load and make us care about them. And we do. We can feel them falling in love. We can feel the helpless emotions that Jack feels when he is trying to tell Rose that he loves her the day of the sinking. It is their relationship that is a great strength of the film.\\n\\nNext, what has to be mentioned is the score by James Horner. Very few times has a motion picture had a score that symbolized the sheer hopelessness and tragedy that is on screen. But here Horner has a perfect and somber piece of music that will bring tears to your eyes, especially when lives and love are lost.\\n\\nAlso, the whole scope of the film is one of tragedy. It is a tragic love story, a tragic story of refugees trying to make a better life for themselves and have it all end abruptly with a giant piece of ice. It is a sad look at bureaucracy and wealth and how it can manipulate and control many things.\\n\\nBut most importantly, this is a love story and an inspirational tearjerker. Rose and Jack fall fast and hard and it doesn\\'t matter that they are from different worlds. Love sees no boundaries. If it is there, nothing can stop it. Not even death.\\n\\nTitanic is perfect in every sense. And as a guy, it is my duty not to cry in movies. I know how ridiculously old fashioned that sounds but it is true. We just aren\\'t supposed to. But I left my testosterone at the door and when I finally let go, I found myself brought to tears as the scenes of children clinging for life in the frigid waters would be enough to bring the strongest man to tears. Cameron has manipulated us to perfection here and even if you find the romance to be embellished (which I don\\'t) to watch this film and know that this happened, is a sad and disturbing reality. Few films have ever done this to me. Few have ever made me feel such a connection to the characters. Titanic does, and by the end of the film, you feel like you know the people of Titanic like they were your long lost relatives.\\n\\nAnd one final note: I can\\'t understand how anyone could not enjoy the film, that\\'s just me. But I know that what moves some does nothing for others. But the backlash towards this film is not necessary. Not every film has to be Ramboesque. Not every film has to be filled with explosions. I am not opposed to those films, I actually love many of them, but I am also prone to well written stories, whether they are love stories or not. Those who criticize this film need to realize that there is a market for this. The gross for this film and the demographics it appealed to confirm that.\\n\\nAs for the comment made earlier about those of us that enjoyed it being teens and have never seen a film before 1990, well I am 27, my brother is 24, my mom is 50 something and my grandmother is in her 80\\'s. And we all loved it. So keep that in mind. And a film does not gross 2 BILLION dollars by having only teens see it.\\n\\nThis is as good as a film gets!\\n\\nOne final note. The SE DVD finally came out and it was worth the wait. The transfer is beautiful and if you are like me and love DVD\\'s so you can access the special features, then this disc is for you. The commentary alone by Cameron makes the disc worth spending your money on. Cameron doesn\\'t do a lot of commentaries, but the ones he does are perhaps the most insightful commentaries out there. Titanic, he outdoes himself. I really recommend everyone who loves this film to get the SE DVD and just sti back for 3 hours and listen to what he has to say. Yes it does entertain, and doesn\\'t feel like 3 hours plus. However this film is pretty poor. Some of the lines like \"that Picasso will never amount to anything\", and \"i\\'m so lucky to be on the Titanic\" are crass beyond belief. Billy Zane is like a baddie out of a bad episode of Scooby-Doo. Why didn\\'t the salvage crew tell the old dear to get on with it, and just tell them where the necklace was? Script over special effects please. This film mixes history (the sinking of the great ship in 1912) with fiction (a story of star-crossed young lovers on the ship: one, an artist with limited income; the other yearning to abandon the stuffiness of her upper-class background and a shallow fiancÃ©).\\n\\nThe 3-D re-release of this film was even more enjoyable the second time. The special effects are phenomenal. The scenes of the sinking ship are perfectly orchestrated and some images can\\'t leave the mind such as the many bodies in the sea after the sinking. Seeing this film after 2001 is eerie; scenes of people jumping off the ship are reminiscent of the destruction of the World Trade Centre.\\n\\nThe love story in the first half works well - mainly because of the fine work by actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Kathy Bates also makes the most of a small role.\\n\\nThis is not to say the film is without flaws in the story. Did people really use the middle-finger gesture back in 1912? A rescue scene was perfectly directed but was also far-fetched. Also, the modern-day character who narrates the story in flashback fails to say what happened to one of her relatives.\\n\\nThe story does well in exposing the injustices imposed by the upper-class whose descendants would be called \"the one per cent\" a century later. Their stuffiness is also exposed with good humour. But sometimes, the soullessness seems exaggerated.\\n\\nBut these flaws don\\'t dilute the great impact of this film. James Cameron\\'s best work is in his directing rather than his writing. This is one of the rare big-budget Hollywood films of the past three decades that truly lives up to its expectations of greatness. - dbamateurcritic\\n\\nRating: 9 out of 10\\n\\nAward-Worth Achievements:\\n\\n1) Directing by James Cameron 2) Special Effects 3) All other technical aspects First I\\'m gonna admit that for 4 months I was ranting about this movie from ocean to ocean. Telling people that if you want to see a ship movie that is worth it, go see Das Boot. Well April 19th I finally went to see the movie. I went in thinking maybe 2 1/2 -3 star and came out emotionally spent. I\\'m a guy and when a movie hits you that hard, I end up liking the movie so much. What really made this movie worked was James Horner\\'s score. Only he could have done it. I\\'m not one of those obsessed people who decided to see the movie 90 times (couldn\\'t afford that even if I wanted to), I don\\'t go out and buy the calendars, puzzles, shirts, diamonds related to the movie. I do like reading about Titanic\\'s history. I like to take photographs, seeing old photographs makes the feeling the more real. Contrary to many people, I think Kate Winslet is the star of the show and not Leo. He\\'s almost a non issue except that if not because of Leo, Kate would be wandering about God only know where or dead already. I hope Kate Winslet gets some movies worth her talent. I know Leo\\'s Man behind the Iron Mask was less than expected. So he\\'s not perfect either. When I watch a movie I try very hard not to think about the politics of a movie. Want a good way to ruin a movie, that\\'s a good way how. It\\'s hard to believe that someone who completely hated the movie decided to see it. (which is dumb anyway. you can\\'t complain until you see it, then you have every right to.) This is only the second time since I began watching movies that my opinions about a movie have changed so dramatically. The other was the highly controversial movie Last Temptation of Christ. (for which for over 5 years I refused to watch it.) Well I better quiet down , and go back to reviewing movies just for friends..... it\\'s a hobby of mine.. (this wasn\\'t a true review anyway. just defending against some of the comments I\\'ve seen so far on this page. thank you.) I\\'ve seen a lot of overblown films in my lifetime, and I know that a lot of people believe the credibility of the Oscars died when Tom Hanks won two Best Actor awards in sequential years, but this film is what really killed the Oscars. The idea that Ben Hur could set a record for winning the most is hilarious when the story is taken into account, but the idea that such a contrived load of nonsense like this could equal it while a really well-made film like Gladiator only gets four awards... well, you get the picture.\\n\\nI won\\'t bore you with a detailed speech about the plot, because I am sure that anyone reading this will have been subjected to exactly that enough times already. Instead, I will just go through some of the things that really stood out in this film.\\n\\nOne thing that always bugs me about this film is how James Cameron claims to pay attention to the most minute detail in his films, and yet the pistol used by Billy Zane has pretty much been positively confirmed by numerous gun collectors as not having been put into production at the time the film was made. It would have been more factually accurate to put a gun from the old Spaghetti Westerns in this film, as a matter of fact. Another thing that flies right in the face of the facts is that a rich power-mad family such as that which our heroine is from would basically beat it into their daughters from birth that they had to take any crap a suitor would dish out at them. It might have been politically incorrect to put this on the screen, but that\\'s the way the society such websites as ChristianAnswers.net wants us to return to actually functioned.\\n\\nAnother aspect of the film that bothers me is Leonard DiCraprio. When we first hear his dialogue about his world travels, well, I was laughing, because he hardly looks old enough to go to the coffee shop unsupervised. Kate looked like she outweighed him by a good fifty pounds, at least, and I\\'m sure the other passengers who were slumming it in steerage would have introduced him to the concept of how prisoners love each other. There\\'s nothing quite like a guy who looks like a girl after being locked in a dank, smelly hole with your average underclass member of a repressive society for a few months. Naturally, the film goes out of its way to make you hate the rest of the passengers, so the proposed idea of having Arnold Schwarzenegger blow up the iceberg and save the day wouldn\\'t have saved the film anyway. Unfortunately, I also found Kate\\'s character rather unconvincing a lot of the time, too. Her behaviour just doesn\\'t quite sync up with what you\\'d expect out of a girl from a circa-191X family of inbreeders.\\n\\nIn short, this film was nothing more than James Cameron\\'s cynical pulling of the strings attached to the heart of every 12-50 year old woman who really ought to know better. Once the cinema-screen impact of the sinking is gone, there is nothing to endear the film to anyone who either has a brain in their head or likes to be made seasick. Instead, what we have is yet another marketing exercise from the mainstream media that pretty much proves ninety percent of people in the world can be told what they want instead of given it. Cameron just hasn\\'t done a good film since Aliens because his ego is way out of control. And boy, does Titanic prove that in a big way. Titanic is now a film which people go out of their way to dismiss. Being contemptuous towards the film is the fashionable thing to do. Admitting you like the film marks you as being desperately uncool. Yes, the Titanic-mania of 1997-98 was a bit much. The box office records, the 11 Oscars...at some point people said enough was enough. But this is a film not so easily dismissed. Perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it. But it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received. It is a very solid film. A compelling story, beautiful visuals, stellar performances...this film has much to recommend it. James Cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of Titanic to the screen. The risks paid off. Titanic is great entertainment, truly captivating, at times legitimately thrilling. It\\'s not a perfect movie, maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins. All the hype, and all the eventual backlash, can\\'t obscure the fact that this is indeed a very good movie.\\n\\nOf course this film is ultimately destined to turn tragic. But the film is not so much about the sinking of a ship. It is a love story. A very unique, heartwarming love story. A story about a young woman who found the love of her life. And found herself. All in the span of a few days aboard the ill-fated Titanic. Part of the film\\'s charm is that this woman, Rose, tells us her story herself. 101 years old when we meet her Rose takes us back to the Titanic. And with her words she brings the great ship, and its passengers, back to life. One of those passengers is Cal, an arrogant man to whom, much to her chagrin, Rose is engaged. Her family needs Cal\\'s money. Rose does not love him but family, and society, dictate she must marry this rather reprehensible man. But then things take a turn. Rose, in unusual and potentially embarrassing circumstances, meets Jack Dawson. While Rose enjoys first-class splendor Jack is a man from another world. A third-class passenger, no money to his name, no standing in society. Jack has no place in Rose\\'s world. But, rather inevitably, Rose decides she wants a place in Jack\\'s world. Yes, it is one of those scarcely believable stories in which a woman falls madly in love with a man she just met. But in her heart Rose knows. Jack is the one. She must follow her heart. She will throw away her privileged life to be with the man she loves. Unfortunately Cal is not going to give her up easily. But before this conflict can play itself out an iceberg intervenes.\\n\\nThe love story of Rose and Jack is easy to embrace, especially when you contrast Jack, so good-hearted, with the vile Cal. Leonardo DiCaprio performs the role of Jack very well, making you believe there is so much more to this guy than is readily apparent. Jack is no ordinary third-class nobody and DiCaprio captures this unique individual wonderfully. But for as good as DiCaprio is it is Kate Winslet who is the real star here. Rose goes on an incredible journey of personal growth and Winslet nails it every step of the way. Rose is radiant, smart, witty and ultimately heroic. Winslet brings all those characteristics to the screen perfectly. Rose finds she is stronger, in so many ways, than she ever imagined. It takes a great actress to evolve along with such a character. And Winslet is clearly a great actress. For as good as DiCaprio and Winslet are in the two key roles the performance of Billy Zane as Cal, the main antagonist, leaves much to be desired. Zane takes Cal\\'s villainy to cartoonish levels, by the end it\\'s impossible to take the character seriously. Spitting his lines rather than speaking them Zane seems absolutely desperate for attention. Unfortunately the attention he brings upon himself is that of sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise stellar cast. Cal had to be evil to make the film\\'s story work. But Zane overplays it so badly you half expect to find out that it was Cal who steered the ship into the iceberg and that he did it on purpose.\\n\\nZane aside the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. While the lead characters are fictional there are many true-life figures aboard the ship. Some, such as ship builder Thomas Andrews, come across very well. Others, such as White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay, do not. Whether those they portray are ultimately heroic, or quite the opposite, the cast by and large do an excellent job bringing these historical figures to life. And Cameron, with a great visual sense, beautiful sets, and state of the art effects, brings the ship to life. Titanic sails again. For the film to really work you had to believe you were really aboard a ship steaming across the Atlantic. Cameron makes it happen. We\\'re right on board, right there with the passengers as they embrace the ship\\'s majesty. And right there with them as the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean. It is the love story which is at the heart of the film\\'s success. But the sinking of the ship is spectacular, both haunting and thrilling. Perhaps the most fun sequence in the film comes when Rose wanders down to third-class where a raucous party is in full swing. We know that nearly all of those passengers are doomed. But Rose ensures they will not be forgotten. In telling us her story she tells us theirs as well. Through her Cameron has given a voice to all who were lost on that tragic night. Titanic is a film not without its flaws. But it is a film journey well worth taking. Three hours fly by as we follow the first, and last, journey of the great ship. As I\\'m sure you know, this was a HUGE hit back when it was in theatres, turning out to be the highest grossing movie of all time, but as hard as it may be to believe, I\\'ve finally seen it for the first time, over eleven years later! I was eleven years old while the film was enjoying its box office success, and yes, I did hear a lot about the movie and how massive it was. I was also soon familiar with the famous song, \"My Heart Will Go On\", performed by the greatly despised Celine Dion. Still, I never actually saw the movie for over a decade. Shortly before finally watching it, I knew that despite its popularity, it has also been widely ridiculed. So, it wouldn\\'t have surprised me if I wasn\\'t very impressed at all, but that didn\\'t exactly turn out to be the case.\\n\\n84 years after the sinking of the Titanic, a group of treasure hunters discover a drawing of a naked woman from the ship\\'s wreckage. A TV report catches the attention of a woman around 101 years old named Rose Calvert, who contacts the treasure hunters to tell them that she is the one in that picture! She then goes with her granddaughter, Elizabeth, to visit the team. Although they are skeptical, the very elderly woman begins to tell them about her experience back in 1912, when she was Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich teenager aboard the Titanic, believed to have gone down with the ship! She tells them how she began an unlikely romantic relationship with a poor young man on board named Jack Dawson after he saved her from a suicide attempt, and how this led to conflict between Rose and her family and oafish fiancÃ©e Caledon Hockley.\\n\\nSeveral months ago, I watched \"Pearl Harbour\", and it seemed that some people compared that film to \"Titanic\", which I thought was not good. As a result, I was expecting the same kind of poor dialogue and romance in this movie, the first of the two. Well, I definitely did find some fairly weak dialogue, and there definitely are flaws in the romance, so the film does have those things in common with its successor, but fortunately to a lesser degree. At least none of it made me laugh here, though it certainly does take some points off. Some of the performances here are also weak, including some of the actors who played the treasure hunters in the 90\\'s parts of the film. When the acting isn\\'t poor, it\\'s basically average, for the most part at least. Oh well, at least I actually cared about what happened to the two main characters, even if they weren\\'t portrayed as well as they could have been. I watched this movie on VHS, and due to its length, it was split onto two tapes. To tell you the truth, I was definitely more impressed with the content on the second tape than the content on the first. Without the climax (which I saw on the second video tape), I would be giving this movie a rating no higher than 6/10, but even that part isn\\'t perfect.\\n\\nI know this is a widely loathed movie. I\\'m also no fan of the widely loathed Celine Dion, who performed the hit song for the film, and am not proud of the fact that she\\'s from my country. (Mind you, I think \"My Heart Will Go On\" is the only song in her catalogue I\\'ve ever heard more than once, and I couldn\\'t even name any of the others.) However, while it is severely flawed, and I wouldn\\'t want to watch it multiple times, I think it could have been much worse. The climax is suspenseful, and before that, the film basically has some good and not so good moments. There may be some FAIRLY moving moments in this 1997 blockbuster, though nothing that even came close to having me in tears, unlike apparently many other viewers. It was also interesting for me seeing Gloria Stuart as 101-year-old Rose, since I had previously seen her in \"The Invisible Man\", which was made over sixty years before this film! Is this version of \"Titanic\" thoroughly inaccurate? I\\'m sure it is, so don\\'t watch it if you want a realistic film based on historical fact. It\\'s a fictional story about a romantic relationship between two fictional people. While it isn\\'t worthy of its position as the highest grossing movie of all time, nor was it worthy of eleven Oscars, at least I think I can call it half-decent. I\\'m not sure what it would have been like watching this film without having seen \"Pearl Harbour\" first, but now that I\\'ve seen them both, I do think \"Titanic\" is pretty good in comparison. My Take: An indisputably sweeping epic. A future classic? It should be.\\n\\n(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)\\n\\nEvery so often, a magnificent epic would just take you away from all that and just sweep you by your feet. James Cameron\\'s unbeatable, $200 million TITANIC is exactly that film, so it just upsets me why some people still don\\'t get it.\\n\\nI was just wondering, it compelled me more than any other film I\\'ve seen for quite awhile (not to mention, it won 11 awards in the Oscars and scored high in the box-office), but why some people try to act cynical and bash this wonderful motion picture (This film is rated 7/10 here on IMDb? Come on!). \"Titanic\" is really that rare kind of masterpiece we don\\'t usually find in today\\'s film era. It wasn\\'t just a big-budgeted film, it was a truly dramatic and touching tale with an old-fashioned romance that movies like CASABLANCA revolutionized. If movies like that are classics in a way TITANIC wanted to revisit, then may I ask what\\'s wrong? The cast, headed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are superb. The direction and writing job by James Cameron is terrific (So is he just getting a hang of the love story thing? I think not!). But one of the real highlights is the superb score by James Horner, and the magnificent theme song. It has become one of my favorite all-time songs. The film too, has become one of my all-time favorites. Not only that, the film is also accurate on some of the facts. James Cameron really made sure to make it as realistic as possible. Like the sinking of the Titanic. Cameron really made that realistic (about the ship splitting in half before sinking). Anyway, combining such elements make it such a winner that won\\'t insult you.\\n\\nI\\'m sure the movie is not without its imperfections, but when a movie\\'s too good to be true, such elements don\\'t come to you. It never did throughout the immense but utterly sweeping 194 minutes. It\\'s entertainment at its best.\\n\\nRating: ***** out of 5. It is a sad commentary on contemporary taste that this movie has received so much critical and popular acclaim. It is redeemed only by its admittedly spectacular special effects. The acting of diCaprio & Winslet is sophomoric. The romantic storyline is improbable and saccharine. The Billy Zane role harks back to the ridiculous mustachioed villains of 19th century melodrama - laughably unbelievable. The score is a disgrace; a movie which aspires so high deserves a symphony orchestra and a John Williams, not the synthesized tin whistle effort it received. The portrayal of social class (everyone in First Class is an evil, repressed, sneering Capitalist Oppressor while everyone in Steerage is a vibrant, life-affirming peasant saint) is right out of a Marxist primer. diCaprio teaching Winslet to spit over the rail is both ridiculous and disgusting. And as for Cameron\\'s ballyhooed fetish for historical accuracy, there is absolutely no evidence that any ship\\'s officer committed suicide during the sinking (but it sure works great on screen, doesn\\'t it?!). Further, he neglects to give a name to the infamous ship that lay 10 miles away and watched the Titanic sink while doing nothing (it was the Californian). And this is the 90\\'s so we have to have our obligatory and gratuitous nude scene and sex scene, don\\'t we (can\\'t make a film without one nowadays)? Those with an interest in the Titanic (possible as a result of this movie) are directed to Walter Lord\\'s incomparable book on the disaster \"A Night to Remember\", and the 1958 J.Arthur Rank production of the same name. Although the effects are not as great (it\\'s 1958 after all) they stand up well, and the script, acting and whole tone of the movie are superior to this bloated and overrated \"blockbuster\". And those who glibly call this \"the best movie of all time\" are gently advised to go out and rent one or more from the following list - \"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"Spartacus\", \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"Citizen Kane\". \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", \"Patton\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"The Quiet Man\".... Kate Winslet (Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind) stars as Rose, a young rich lady who travels on the Titanic, the boat which is destined to change human kind for ever as it sets sail in 1912. The story is told from an older Rose\\'s point of view as she experiences life on the \"unsinkable ship\". Meeting Jack Dawson (Leo Di Caprio Â\\x96 Gangs of New York) this charming romantic tale brings out a heart-warming story of young love with an unmissable ending.\\n\\nWinner of 11 Oscars, David Cameron\\'s Titanic is a wonderful tale of two young people who meet and begin to learn about life in different ways from one another. Winslet and Di Caprio are perfect as the two characters. From the wealthy and stubborn Rose to the relaxed and positive Jack, audiences can appreciate each character\\'s different backgrounds and engage more into their lives. The characters are well developed in this film, giving the film more depth. Di Caprio and Winslet have good on screen chemistry making the film engaging and light hearted.\\n\\nMany critics have argued its predictability and its clichÃ©s but with a film like this, you have to look past them to the depth and control of the power of the characters and the surroundings in which they find themselves.\\n\\nThe ending for me was really powerful and difficult to watch, I was close to tears. However it is a must watch as the film delivers twist after twist in a powerful climax.\\n\\nIt\\'s a very good film and one of the best love stories of all time No doubt that James Cameron\\'s \"Titanic\" is an epic story, told in grand fashion. But let\\'s get one thing straight right now.\\n\\nThis is NOT a human interest piece. This is a special effects piece.\\n\\nLook at all the Academy Awards it has won. The majority of them in the technical arena, most logically. If perhaps not the strongest in character motivation, Cameron is first and foremost a craftsman. It\\'s what he works best at (just look at the \"terminator\" films). Every detail is lovingly placed and arranged with a perfectionist\\'s eye and hand. And the final half of the film (which I\\'ll get to) is a masterpiece in itself.\\n\\nBut as far as characterization goes, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play their parts like good soldiers but are simply too shallow and unconvincing as the puppy-lovers caught up in the huge sweep of tragedy (a plot device as old as motion pictures themselves) to project much emotion or personality. Instead, they just walk around and say their lines as the rest of the movie goes on its merry way.\\n\\nWhich is as it should be, I guess, as the movie does indeed have its own agenda and does its work very well, thank you.\\n\\nThe final half of the movie is what everyone is interested in, anyway. And Cameron and company acquit themselves very well as the Titanic slowly splits and sinks into the icy deep waters below.\\n\\nEvery single moment has its drama as the different passengers confront their mortality while the ship confronts its own. Older couples comforting each other, parents holding their children tightly as the water rises around them, musicians valiantly playing hymns for the passengers, the doomed ship\\'s designer calmly waiting by the fireplace as his creation collapses around him.\\n\\nIn this respect, \"Titanic\" deserves every award and accolade it has received, even more so. No one modern director has worked so hard and emphatically on a vision as Cameron has here. But as far as the human effort, he is the modern-day Hitchcock: herding his cast cattle-like from scene to scene, positioning them just so to emphasize the FX.\\n\\nBut just consider the FX, and you\\'ll understand.\\n\\nIn view of the sight of the Titanic itself, that earns ten easy stars. But subtract four stars for failing to find one cast member or character as interesting as the ship itself (no, not even Gloria Stuart. Sorry, Gloria).\\n\\nIn all, six stars for \"Titanic\". Fast forward to when the iceberg makes its appearance and you may enjoy it even more. The movie puts light on the romance that Jack and Rose shared. Although Jack died that night but the love he placed in her heart will not die till she is alive. Titanic is among the first Hollywood movies that I got to see on television. I like this movie from the day I first saw it. It is just not about the emotions of the characters in the movie but the emotions of people who watch it as well.\\n\\nDirection, Screenplay, Cinematography: I got to know about huge investment made in construction of sets, water bodies and their working. Well I would say they all got well along (4/5).\\n\\nTone: Movie takes us on a ride where two people fall in love but one dies as titanic sinks. It is how Rose has those emotions still with her and would go away only with her death. As they call now grown old Rose to explore sank titanic to find lost jewel. The jewel is although with Rose and the secret that what she does of it will die with her. I would say it as epic romantic tone. (5/5).\\n\\nMusic: The movie puts light on how the musicians on board were still performing as titanic was sinking. It captures your heart (3.5/5).\\n\\nActing: Acting is good (3.5/5).\\n\\nFinal Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)]. The story was clear to everyone before seeing, apart from the romance of the two main actors. The plot was still sometimes exciting. You could cut the film by an hour, then it would have been easier for the audience. When you have a film this big and successful, it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough, I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let\\'s see...\\n\\nJim Cameron didn\\'t need to create this huge-scale, heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the movie-going world, though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history (9/11, Pearl Harbor, etc). Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail, this film is without peer.\\n\\nThe cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a world-class actor, but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn\\'t have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" is always likeable and the rest of the cast (mostly Brits) does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film\\'s best performance as Winslet\\'s greedy, snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguard/enforcer. As far as the special effects go, it\\'s hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better. Each time you view it, you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking, but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive. As of this writing, only three known survivors are still alive. One can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of, shoot, and edit the last hour of the film. The results are terrific.\\n\\nThere are flaws in the overall mix, however. Some of the dialogue (Mostly Leo\\'s) is down right corny. \"When you\\'ve got nothing, you\\'ve got nothing to lose!\" or \"You seem like kind of an indoor girl\" are two examples. Also, the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable. Keep in mind that a first class ticket on Titanic in today\\'s economy would go for $80,000! These were some RICH people, and they wouldn\\'t have let a guy like Dawson near them.\\n\\nAnyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance. This film is a romance above all else. Just tough it out if it bothers you. It\\'s not that bad.\\n\\nThis film is tragic, exciting, sensual, pretentious, corny, extravagant, and even a little cheesy. And I love EVERY DAMN MINUTE OF IT!!!!!!!!\\n\\n5 of 5 stars.\\n\\nSo sayeth the Hound. I write in bytes. Saves time. This movie a gem. A rather fictional love story of poor boy comes on to rich girl from social climbing family who are down on their luck. Evil villain of a fiancÃ© for the girl. The poor boy is a talented artist who has spent time sketching naked harlots in Gay Paree, lol. Rich girl strips her clothes off and poses for boy artist. Nasty fiancÃ© goes gunning for poor boy. Puppy dog valet/hit-man for fiancÃ© does some really goofy chasing down the ship for poor artist boy.\\n\\nAs an OSU history major, I feel, in all seriousness:\\n\\nI know this story was fictional, and that the real story was tragic and ugly. Sometimes I think the supposed disaster was a real set-up and early harbinger of World War I. Perhaps the ship designers and certain cruise line executives were in cahoots with the evil perpetrators of the war. The war started in Europe in 1914, two years after the Titanic disaster. Not just a coincidence. German leaders had been arguing among themselves for decades leading up to the war, and perhaps they figured that a disaster really embarrassing the British and Americans would be a real coup in their attempt to conquer the world.\\n\\nMaybe the Germans were investors in White Star, and wanted the insurance money to fund their growing war. Wars do cost lots of money, and Germany as a united nation began in 1871, only about 40 years earlier. Young nations don\\'t have a lot of money to fund such endeavors.\\n\\nThere are no accidents, according to philosophical theory. Germany had been in unrest all during the early part of the 20th Century -- events leading up to World War I. Another close-in-time famous ship disaster was 1915: the Lusitania, hit-destroyed-sunk by German U-boats (armed with torpedoes) who had warned that ship not to be caught in its shipping lanes. Lots of famous and important people were aboard the Lusitania, and also lots of rich-and-famous were aboard the Titanic. Even the ships\\' names are rather alike.\\n\\nThe chilling part is that it is now almost 2012 -- 100 years after the fatal Titanic disaster. Now, in 2007, 2012 is five years away. All things come back around, and I imagine there will be some sort of commemorative remembrances regarding the Titanic in 2012. Why has this \\'accident\\' been called the most famous ship disaster in history? Why are all those movies (and even a Broadway musical) made of this unfortunate loss of life and wealthy property?\\n\\nTitanic: How could such a magnificent ship suddenly crack up like so much balsa wood? I feel there was lots of sabotage and manipulation. I hope that there were real first-love stories aboard this ship, as suggested in this movie.\\n\\nThe Queen of the Sea was supposed to be bigger, stronger, better, and much more well-built than all other ships of its day, not to mention ultra-luxurious and mega-speedy. Its riveting was world-class, and its workmanship unparalleled. Nay, not an accident, but perhaps, and only perhaps, a \"red herring\" to take the world\\'s attention away from the growing Teutonic holocaust in Europe. In this, James Cameron\\'s first masterpiece, we see the Titanic like never before, romanticized, with a love story to boot! When released in 1997, Titanic was expected to be a financial flop for Paramount and Fox studios, who had put up a record amount of production money, only to wind up with the highest grossing film of all time. A record that was kept for twelve years, until Cameron\\'s next film, \\'Avatar\\' outsold Titanic\\'s ticket sales in 2009. We find Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and Billy Zane in a love triangle to trump all love triangles prior! The film, although partially based on actual events and made up people, was a hit with audiences in the summer of 1997, breaking box office records from start to finish. A great cast and great direction, along with the most up-to date special effects of the time make for a splendid experience, 8/10. nan nan I think that,as movie watchers,we all have at least one film that we wanted to like so much, that a disappointment would just be too much to handle.One such film for me was Titanic.Thankfully, it did not let me down,although the movie is not without it\\'s imperfections.I\\'ll talk about the great things first.Never has the ship been more masterfully recreated.I guess it took all this time to have the technology to do so.The special effects are indeed the best I have seen in any film.As for the acting, Billy Zane really steals the show from our two heroes,Leo and Kate,as the greedy,relentless Cal Hockley.Zane\\'s performance is one of the better I have seen when it comes to villains.The recreation of the ship\\'s final moments is spellbinding.The moment that touched my heart the most would have to be the \"Nearer My God to Thee\" scene.You are not human if this moment does not touch you to some degree.The only complaint I have with this film is the use of humor in some questionable places,For example,as Rose is battling to free Jack from his handcuffs and rescue him from certain doom,he utters the line,\"I\\'ll wait right here\".I certainly don\\'t think one liners would be appropriate in that situation,though some may disagree.Overall, this film is a great blend of fiction and real life,and if you can sit still for three hours,I definitely recommend it. Titanic, is a fictional take on the tragic maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. The events of the ill fated journey of the ship is told in the midst of a beautiful love story between two people of differing social backgrounds & how they overcome all odds to be together. Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio), is a man who boarded the Titanic by chance. It was a gamble which had a third class ticket to the Titanic at stake. Rose DeWitt Bukater(Kate Winslet) is a woman of the royal family. She is one of the first few people who got a first class ticket for the very first voyage of the Titanic, along with other famous, wealthy & important people. So it was fate & fate alone, that brought Jack & Rose together. This is the synopsis of the movie.\\n\\nThis is my review of the new 3D version of Titanic that released in 2012. First off, what a beautiful story. Sure, it\\'s predictable, but, the way in which it\\'s written ensures that you don\\'t get bored even for a single second. The way that Jack & Rose fall in love is one of the highlights of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet share great chemistry together. Not to mention, that they\\'ve acted brilliantly! Both Oscar worthy performances. Unfortunately, only Kate Winslet won the award for best actress. The supporting characters are impressive as well. The way they\\'ve shown how the ship first hits the iceberg, starts flooding, tilts at a 180 degree angle & finally snaps into two makes the movie. All this looks even better in 3D! The best conversion from 2D to 3D ever! So, grab your 3D glasses, popcorn & soft drink & be prepared to witness a once in a lifetime experience all over again! James Cameron, take a bow! A must watch! Romance movies are not my genre. There I said it, now all you teenage girls (or ex-teenage girls I should probably say) can come with torches to my house and protest. That said, I think this movie is not only a dud on the technical level, but also on the content plateu.\\n\\nJames Cameron loves creating megadose action flicks (Terminator 2, True Lies, etc.) that usually require little background or very uninvolving plots. The guy has little to no screenwriting ability (if you read his scripts, particularly for ALIENS, you will see that there is nothing to applaud. Fortunately, as a director, Cameron can transcend the difficulties of putting images on paper and creating some impressive images (even if the scenes themselves are rather dull).\\n\\nBy all means, ABYSS and Terminator 2 deserved Oscars for Cinematography, but this movie is merely overrated end-of-the-year garbage (see also CHICAGO) that lacks emotion and style in his camerawork. Much of his work here in Titanic seems more like he\\'s stealing ideas from Brian DePalma rather than being inventive.\\n\\nCameron learned from Corman, plain and simple, and that similar attitude is displayed here. Grabbing a cast from a fashion catalogue, Cameron proves (once again) that he hasn\\'t lost his touch in how to be EXPLOITIVE of human emotion. That might explain his love life problems.\\n\\nOn the rest of the technical notes, this movie did NOT deserve most of the awards it was nominated for. The Sound is on par with T2 (read: awful) and the effects were unenlightening. Someone want to explain how Face/Off didn\\'t get that award? The visual and SFX were fair. Fair to poor that is, Cameron has lost his ability to know when to use CGI and when not to. Film editing= totally awful, this was waaayy to long even for me. Hence I fell asleep three times during the sinking.\\n\\nMusic= James Horner\\'s score is nothing new. It rather reminded me of \"The Ten Commandments\" and \"Ben-Hur\". If I had a time machine, I would\\'ve given him the Oscar for ALIENS instead. And as for the Director, what a joke. Now Cameron has become a recluse crackhead rather than therecluse genius he was.\\n\\nSo do the math, I have succeeded in knocking off 7 Oscars from this overrated POS. Now it\\'s on par with Forrest Gump where it belongs. Overall: 1.5 out of 5. Don\\'t waste your time. Watched one of All time Favorite Romance Films thats Titanic one of my favorite Chick Flick Films Featured an Amazing Performance from a Stellar Lead By Kate Winslet(Sense and Sensibility) as Rose Dawson a a High class society woman who is forced in to marriage with an owner of a Pittsburgh Steel Mill. Leonardo DiCaprio(Romeo + Juliet) as Jack Dawson as Poor,Lower class individual from Wisconsin who wins a ticket to go aboard the Titanic .Also Starring Frances Fisher(Unforgiven) as Ruth BuKater, Billy Zane(The Phantom) as Cal Hockley and David Warner(Tron) as Spicer Lovejoy. It was amazing but sad story but you were really rooting for Rose & Jack to get to get together which is awesome they showed that people can fall in love no matter what society has them labeled as. also this was an epic romance to the key all the shots for the Titanic felt massive amazing Cinematography by Russell Carpenter(True Lies), Production Design from Peter Lamont(Aliens),Costume Design from Deborah Lynn Scott(Heat) , Score by James Horner(Star Trek II:Wrath Of Khan) and Direction by James Cameron(Terminator 2:Judgment) Truly an Epic Romance film that cannot matched 9/10 Voice of Dean Stockwell as Admiral Al Calavicci: \"Sam, Ziggy says you\\'ve leapt into one Jack Dawson of Chippewa Falls,Michigan and that there\\'s a 78.5% chance that you\\'re here to save the life of one Rose Dewitt Bukater.\" Well, at least that\\'s the way I see it. I may not see Scott Bakula or Stockwell, but for some reason I get the feeling that behind DeCaprio\\'s pretty boy looks, it is Bakula as time-traveler Sam Beckett pulling his strings. I can just hear Stockwell after the nude drawing: \"You drew that while she was.....And I missed it?! Rats!!\" Back to the movie, it may be a chick flick for girls to see Leo, but it does have Kate Winslet for the guys. She looks incredible with red hair! Billy Zane should get an award for the sheer arrogance he plays (maybe it comes naturally) and David Warner should get the Jerk Reward for his portrayal as Zane\\'s stooge. Exceptionally talented Kathy Bates is wonderfully likeable as Molly Brown, a far cry from her \"Misery\" role, but then she does excellant work in everything she does. Cameron pays a lot of detail into this work, or not considering the bloopers constantly being nick-picked. The story of two lovers separated by fate works well against the tragedy of the Titanic\\'s sinking as does telling it from a past point of view at the site of a salvage expedition with Bill Paxton. I haven\\'t seen him since \"Wierd Science.\" The sinking is very well done. We just don\\'t see a miniature sinking as have we seen in so many other movies, we see the drowning, the suffering, the deck going up, the sheer terror and true nature of the human spirit when faced with its mortality, the people fighting for life boats......this is the movie to put an end to further Titanic movies. Cameron has put together here not just an incredibly powerful movie, but a chick flick that even guys would want to see! This was a great movie. It\\'s hard to see how I could improve on it. It was over budget - ambitious - and amazing.\\n\\nI\\'ll start with the period scenery of the early 1900s - very nicely done. The range of dress styles and accommodations aboard the ship as they relate to class was impressive. The recreation of the Titanic was also well done. Throughout the movie the viewer gets to journey throughout this large ship and see everything from the huge engine room through first the class dining area.\\n\\nAlso nicely done was the music (songs and music vocalizations). They integrated very nicely with the story and the idea of an ocean liner.\\n\\nThe story - though fictional - was entertaining. Instead of creating a simple story at the time of the Titanic, Cameron gave us two - one now and one then - and linked the two nicely. There is plenty of action, romance and fun.\\n\\nOf course, everything in the story happens against the backdrop of one of the most famous disaster events in history. Cameron took his time depicting the tragic event and gave us a seemingly realistic insight into how events unfolded during the sinking event. The special effects were excellent.\\n\\nIf you\\'re in the mood for a great story and have an interest in the Titanic, definitely consider watching this movie. Whatever people think about this film it certainly had the magic ingredients at the box office. Even after all the Potter and Rings movies it\\'s still grossed nearly twice as much as any other film.\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine many people on the planet don\\'t know what happened to the Titanic. The story is set around the unlikely romance between Jack and Rose. The film is pretty much split into two halves. The first is the romance between Jack and Rose, whilst the second is all about the boat going down. The effects are still very impressive and Leo and Kate look nice enough. Maybe it\\'s not quite deserving of the Oscar glory and box office, but it\\'s still a fairly entertaining movie. 8/10 James Cameron doesn\\'t do what James Cameron does for James Cameron...\\n\\nJames Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron IS James Cameron.\\n\\nOh and this film is flawless. While some viewers were disappointed that this wasn\\'t just another A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, I believe that the use of the fictional characters was an effective story-telling device.\\n\\nWe are brought into the story through Jack and Rose with the historical characters and events as a backdrop. The same device is used in such great films as GONE WITH THE WIND, THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE, and THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON. History is thus brought to life without being ponderous. Back at the 90s when I was a little child, I loved all of the films that came out at the time, but I never heard of James Cameron before until at 2009, when that guy made his sci-fi epic \"Avatar\", I saw it and loved it as much as anyone else despite it\\'s flawed story (loved the concept, by the way) and considered one of the best movies James Cameron has ever made since the first two Terminator movies (I\\'ve watched them and I thought they were completely epic) and Aliens. So, I decided to watch this on a VHS copy that I used to have until it vanished and I was officially moved by it.\\n\\nBefore I could get to the positive aspects, I\\'ve heard some criticisms from other people who said that this is an extremely overlong and overrated film. Well, I will admit that this film does have some flaws, they\\'re outweighed by it\\'s redeeming qualities. The three hour length is longer, but I was impressed at how the it moves very quickly and the script, while staying true to the tragedy of the ship, has it\\'s cheesy moments. The film looks very pretty and the look of the ship is beautiful. It also has some gorgeous costumes and very solid special effects. The music from James Horner is lovely and is one of his best scores in a feature film so far especially the heart-rendering song \"My Heart Will Go On\" by Celine Dion and is one of the best music songs in cinema history.\\n\\nThe direction from James Cameron is amazing and helps the story with complete focus while giving a intriguing atmosphere to it. The story is very rich in detail, gives the characters a lot of development perfectly and the love story, while obvious, is really moving. The strongest aspects, however, goes to the climax of the movie for has drama, heart, and comedy perfectly mixed together and a flawless cast to make the characters more interesting, emotive, and likable. Leonardo Di Caprio gives out one of his best performances as Jack Dawson, Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose, and Billy Zane is a great villain due to his deliciously cartoony and over-the-top performance. Other actors like Kathy Bates, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, and more did well with their roles and the character development along with their interactions with the main characters were amazing.\\n\\nOverall, Titanic isn\\'t nearly as excellent as James Cameron\\'s previous films, but this is a beautifully moving and a 15-year old epic film that will always be recommended to others as one of the best movies ever made in cinema. With all my heart, this deserves a thumbs up from me. I have seen Titanic about a million times, and I have to say that the movie is a very entertaining and sad drama film. James Cameron did a wonderful job in being a director, and the acting was great. I give Titanic a 10 out of 10. :) Thought to be the most popular motion picture of all time by many, this film is probably also the most hated. Director James Cameron created an epic disaster story combined with a sloppily put together love story on the ill-fated, \"unsinkable\" R.M.S. Titanic. We all knew the story of TITANIC, so why did we all bother to go see it? We were curious about the events leading up to the disaster and I\\'m sure there were many who were interested in seeing the stupid love story.\\n\\nJames Cameron wanted to make a love story. He said so himself. But, what he should have done was create a love story, and only a love story. But, no, he decided to combine his romance tale with the tragic story of Titanic. As soon as the iceberg hits, the story becomes just like an action-adventure movie with a little bit of love thrown in. And Cameron also dragged his stupid romance out for almost two hours before the real reason people went to see this movie happened. We all wanted a great movie about the story of Titanic, not a love story. How this film garnered so many damn Academy Awards is beyond me. I mean, a couple would have been understandable, but TITANIC won almost ALL of the awards, and I ain\\'t kidding when I say \\'all\\'.\\n\\nThe cast was also all-star: Leonardo DiCaprio (if I was Cameron, I would have gotten someone else to play that part, as no one likes DiCaprio--this probably discouraged many people from seeing this film), Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, David Warner, Victor Garber, Bill Paxton, Danny Nucci,Jonathan Hyde, Bernard Fox and Jason Barrey lead the way in probably the biggest hit of all time...and the biggest flop. TITANIC gets 3/5. nan This is a good movie but let\\'s not consider it a masterpiece like some have do. I still don\\'t understand why it won 11 oscars. You know the story, that incredible ship, the Titanic, who sunk on his first trip in 1912. It\\'s the whole love story between Leonardo and Kate that\\'s not very interesting. For me, the best part of the film, I must admit, it\\'s when the ship go down under! Bernard Hill was excellent as the captain of the Titanic.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Titanic is a bit too long but still a good movie. But let\\'s not consider a classic too soon.\\n\\n8 out of 10. The start was very Disney like.Very bad dialogue and very condescending.But I was patient and I found the movie turning into gold with every passing minute starting with the scene where Leonardo was dining with the rich people,then from then on the film just kept impressing me.The movie started loosing it\\'s Disney compromises with every minute passing.This movie could have been perfect with a better start,particularly with the dialogue.But after all the positive things this movie has shown,it has my blessings as a bonafide classic.Very depressing though.Very sad story but that was intended and the love story had it\\'s power thru the tragedies around it.One would expect tragedy with a movie regarding this sort of historical disaster anyhow.It reminds me of another romantic movie with a very tragic ending that I love which is \"A Place In The Sun\" with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift.But I accepted the tragic end of that one becouse it was made clear that Clift confessed to murder in one form or another.But Leonardo in this movie was such a gallant heroic young man that it depresses us to see him end that way.I\\'m not a nut for depressing romantic movies but I can appreciate them.This movie won me in the end.It also had one of the most suspensefull scenes I have ever seen.I was literally sweating and could hardly contain myself when Leonardo was being rescued from those handcuffs!This movie had that classic magic indeed......... On a recent viewing of Titanic, I realized that some of the Special Effects now look slightly dodgy. Still, the bulk of the film holds up very well. The beginning is a bit slow as the older Rose narrates her story. Bill Paxton is wasted in a thankless part. Leo and Kate\\'s tremendous chemistry makes it all worthwhile though. They absolutely convinced me they were in love. Once the ship strikes the iceberg, the scenes of terror and mayhem that follow are mesmerizing to watch. Titanic remains an awesome spectacle with some tender scenes and a heart-breaking romance.\\n\\nOverall 9/10 The first half of this movie focused on a romance that I did not care about, and yet, I was still somehow engrossed by it all. Rationally, I can understand that the story was fairly ordinary, but somehow, I was riveted. This is something that I cannot explain. For every scene after the iceberg is first spotted, however, I can fully understand why I loved this movie so much. The action scenes in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping, and this fact is the primary reason why this is one of my favorite films. However, I can certainly agree with those who found this to be a real tearjerker. Seeing so many innocent people preparing to die is heartbreaking in the extreme, and these scenes will always stand out as some of the finest that I will ever see. But make no mistake about it, I view this as an action film first, not as a emotional drama. And since I view it this way, I strongly encourage action fans who somehow avoided this movie to give it a chance, because heart-pounding entertainment doesn\\'t get any better than this. The increasing slight sense of foreboding, the humour at the climax that doesn\\'t lighten up the tragedy but instead somehow makes it even more unsettling and ominous, the charming and extremely amiable star-crossed protagonists, to name a few. James Cameron\\'s Titanic is one of the best indirect adaptations of Shakespeare\\'s masterwork, Romeo and Juliet. Even when it comes to the issues I have with this film, most of them are pretty much similar to those I have with the play. And I\\'ve always found these issues justifiable to some extent. Also, the visuals are uniquely spectacular, and CÃ©line Dion\\'s My Heart Will Go On is timeless!\\n\\n(8.5/10) nan nan Before this film, the director, James Cameron was best known for action thrillers such as Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss and True Lies Â\\x96 all of which delivered the goods for action fans. After sitting through Titanic, however, I think he should have stayed with the true action-thriller genre, because when you mix genres, you can get mixed results. And, in this case, it shows...\\n\\nThe story of the Titanic is well known: an \\'unsinkable\\' ship sinks on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912 with most of the male passengers dying. Cameron, using the technical wizardry he\\'d perfected in his earlier works, made you feel as though you were actually there, instead of being a mere spectator; the special effects are truly stunning. For action fans, that aspect of the film is relatively brief, however, because the bulk of the film and the very contrived plot are more concerned with the recovery of a fabulous jewel Â\\x96 a symbol of love -- from the existing wreck, left there by the heroine, Rose (Kate Winslet) with her all too brief lover, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) who perishes as the ship sinks. How the two lovers come together in the film and how the jewel comes to have so much significance forms the basis of the plot; the details of the sub-plot Â\\x96 the actual events leading to and including the sinking -- are mere props to the overall story of first love. The metaphor is thus complete Â\\x96 as the ship sinks on its first voyage, so also first love sinks.\\n\\nAll of that is explored in flashback, as a burgeoning love between two people who would not otherwise have met, anytime, anywhere else. So the actual loss of the Titanic is, in that sense, incidental to the greater loss suffered by each and every person who lost a loved one in that tragedy. To that extent, the film succeeds in its presentation but only because of the calibre of the acting. As an account of the tragedy of the Titanic, however, it\\'s a misnomer and a failure; while, as entertaining escapism Â\\x96 well, as the saying goes -- nothing succeeds like excess.\\n\\nTo find out how the tragic event actually happened, you\\'d be better off getting a copy of A Night To Remember (1958) from your video store instead. nan nan So you flip through the cable channels on your remote. The same old music videos are running, and the reruns get tiring. Later, you find something interesting. The evening news, Entertainment Tonight, 60 Minutes, VH1, and every other network airs clips from this, the biggest money-making film in history. TITANIC emerges as a genuine Hollywood classic for the second generation of American cinema. Never since GONE WITH THE WIND has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from James Cameron. It\\'s more than just a love story. It\\'s an all-out disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score. It even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anyway.\\n\\nBrilliant use of photography is what stands out the best. Imagine every single little piece of detail that wouldn\\'t fit on this message. Replicas of the engine room and the interior designs are highly crafted to maximize the full experience of being on the Titanic while sailing on crisp, clear sea water filled with dolphins swimming with grace. During the night, one can look up the starry skies while the bright lights shine. How tragic it is for a luxury liner to capsize in half, sinking miles beneath the surface, and showing off the greatest achievement in motion picture special effects! A job extremely well done! Who will match this kind of excellence in the near future?\\n\\nAs for the players, the pair of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are now remembered as the Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh of the next generation. Both are young, of course, and they really can ACT! Winslet should have taken home the Oscar (what blasphemy of those Academy Awards judges!). Her performance as \"Rose\" is a show stealer, as she did most of the incredible acting far better than today\\'s young actresses. From smoking a cigarette, to possessing true beauty, to posing nude, to being a heroine, and to become a survivor, this will be a role so hard to beat in Winslet\\'s future films. DiCaprio, on the other hand, also does magnificent as a \"street boy\" and a \"troublemaker\". The second half is the most important time to discover his best talents, including the end. Both are sensational in almost every respect.\\n\\nWell, you can\\'t always expect a movie to be perfect. TITANIC\\'s shortcomings are relatively minor. The \"modernized\" scenes don\\'t quite prove true to a historical masterpiece made with expensive sets and decorations. Mr. Jerry Garcia Lookalike should\\'ve changed his shirt, instead of wearing the one with \"Happy Face\" shot in the head. But Gloria Stuart as the old \"Ross\" makes up for the modern touch in telling and revisiting the Titanic story through her past experiences. It\\'s also important that we already know how the disaster had become, and that the movie tells under a fictional basis.\\n\\nOf localized interest: Diana Morgan was once a TV news anchor for an NBC station out here. She has recently taken on an acting career playing the role of a news reporter, notably in BABYLON 5. You will hardly get to notice her on that small TV set shown at the start of the film, but you can hear her voice.\\n\\nOver three hours of powerful and unprecedented movie imagery. To date, it may very well be the greatest film ever made. Not the greatest film of all time but then again not the worse. Titanic is, at best, an average movie which contains some pretty impressive special effects. The story however is not believable and neither are the characters. It was way too long for one thing. I do applaud James Cameron for target marketing this film toward the right audience i.e. the teenage/younger crowd which is where it made its money. That of course IS the bottom line. This film probably isn\\'t even the best one about the tragic event. Years from now people may view this movie and say \"How did this win the Academy Award for Best Picture that year?\" nan At over $1.8 Billion worldwide (excluding rentals), `Titanic\\' is the most commercially successful film of all time. That is double the next highest grossing film (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace). Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it won 11 including best picture in 1998. Everything about this film was big. It ran over 3 hours and had a budget of $200 million which is larger than the U.S. box office for all but 30 movies in the history of filmmaking. This was a TITANIC film in every sense of the word. But, was it any good? Well, actually it was!\\n\\nThe film was written and directed by James Cameron, who before this was most renowned for writing and directing `Terminator\\' films. The story was a combination love story, period piece and disaster movie. As a love story was good. As a period piece, it was wonderfully precise in its myriad details, both generally and as to specifics about the Titanic and her passengers. As an epic disaster movie, it was utterly colossal.\\n\\nFrom a directorial perspective, this film is unparalleled; a feat of gargantuan proportions. In addition to the normal directorial duties, Cameron had to coordinate mammoth model-building projects, deep sea filming of the original ship, thousands of hours of painstaking research, elaborate visual effects, and hundreds of special sets. To be able to pull all those elements together at all is a superhuman task. The result was truly remarkable entertainment.\\n\\nCameron took a chance on Leonardo DiCaprio. The studios wanted Matthew McConaughey but Cameron insisted on DiCaprio. It was a gamble that paid off. DiCaprio gave a career performance and his enthusiasm and charm lit up the screen. Kate Winslet was also a fresh talent with only five minor films to her credit before Â\\x91Titanic\\'. Her performance was sparkling and her chemistry with DiCaprio made the love story urgent and magical. Oddly, she hasn\\'t worked much since, and is fast slipping back into the obscurity from whence she came.\\n\\nThis was not as much a film as it was a fluctuation in the space-time continuum. Forces and emotions from the original event were transported to 1997, and they clutched us with a power that left us spellbound. It was neither the best story ever told, nor the best film ever made, but it was certainly the greatest filmmaking achievement to date in its sheer size and scope. As a motion picture, I rated it a 9/10. As an epic, there is no scale large enough to rate it. The box office speaks for itself. It\\'s bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the IMDb\\'s Top 250. Even stranger still, many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it (just ask anyone under the age of 25). This is not due to its quality, but to its hype. It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about \"Titanic.\" The film had the odds against it: it\\'s a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity. By the time the spoofs of the film\\'s most famous scenes came along, \"Titanic\\'s\" reputation was already in danger. After that, people began only to see the spoofs, and now the film\\'s popularity has sunk to where the real ship is.\\n\\nI had fond memories of the film from when it was popular, so I decided to perform an experiment: even after the immense backlash the film suffered, could it still hold up? The answer is a resounding YES!\\n\\n\"Titanic\" opens when a treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond that he is looking for. Soon after releasing his findings, an elderly woman (Gloria Stuart) claims that it\\'s her in the picture. So Lovett flies her out to his ship to tell her the story behind the diamondÂ\\x85As a young woman, she was sailing to America to live the life of a boring society lady in a loveless marriage. Planning on ending it all, she is about to jump ship when she is saved by a young man from steerage. Thus begins a classic love story that is doomed from the start by complications other than those they began with.\\n\\nThe reason the film is so good is because the two central characters are brilliantly written and acted. Leonardo DiCaprio became an instant heartthrob to girls around the world (something he apparently hated), and it\\'s not hard to see why. DiCaprio has everything to make the male lead of an epic romance work: he\\'s good-looking and talented (Winslet was honored with an Oscar nomination for her performance, although it\\'s hard to understand why DiCaprio was left out, because he equals her). Jack Dawson is an immensely likable guy. He falls hard for Rose, someone who he knows is clearly out of his league. But he\\'s so immensely likable that we want him to win Rose\\'s heart. His new lover, Rose, is no ordinary society girl, much as she tries. She can\\'t stand the rigidly controlled life she\\'s going to lead, and Jack is her escape. But while she may wear a corset, she\\'s no damsel in distress. She\\'s independent and tough. The romance works because Jack and Rose are meant for each other.\\n\\nTheir supporting cast is excellent. The two most important supporting characters are Rose\\'s fiancÃ©e, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher). Cal Hockley is a vicious snob with a constant sneer on his face. He comes from a wealthy family, and will do anything to get what he wants. He demands obedience from Rose, something she will not give (to anyone, much less Cal). Her mother, Ruth, is just as snobbish and cruel, but she\\'s also desperate. Their family was left virtually penniless, and she\\'s trying to save face. As cruel and despicable as they are, neither one becomes a caricature. Zane and Fisher should have dually been honored with awards for their acting. Bates is especially noteworthy as the delightfully brash \"new money\" Molly Brown.\\n\\n\"Titanic\" was the most expensive film of the 20th century, and it\\'s clear that every penny was put to good use. \"Epic\" doesn\\'t begin to describe this movie. It\\'s huge in spectacle, and the sinking of the ship, which takes up the last half hour, is jaw-dropping. But that\\'s not the only place where the effects were used. We never get a sense that we\\'re looking at sets or CGI; from every frame of the ship, we believe that we are on the ship with the characters. Interesting note: Cameron actually went down to the wreckage and filmed footage there. But that doesn\\'t stop there. Cameron wrote a script that allows us to view every part of the ship (and in a way that\\'s plausible.\\n\\nJames Cameron has long been considered a god of action movies, but this is the first time his skills were honored. Not only is Cameron a wizard with special effects, he is also a master storyteller. \"Titanic\" is a long film (as all epics are), but not one of the 3+ hours of footage is wasted. The film moves, and there is never a dull spot. He knows the speed at which a person gets involved in the story, and uses this to his advantage. But the biggest accomplishment is that he makes the romance, one of the most difficult genres to dabble in, work with immense effectiveness. The romance burns up the screen, so much that we\\'re more concerned with Jack and Rose\\'s fates than we are taking in the sight of the sinking ship. And the scene where Jack draws Rose\\'s picture is potently erotic (especially for a PG-13 movie, which shows not real nudity or sex, but it is strongly implied).\\n\\nI realize that I am not writing this to people who haven\\'t seen the movie (are there such people?). I am writing it to those who are now convinced that this is a sappy and painfully bad film. I assure you: it\\'s as good as it was the first time you saw it. I really love this movie.\\n\\nKate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have excellent chemestry.\\n\\nWhatever cheesiness this movie may have works in its favor, because it makes the later scenes so much more impactful.\\n\\nI always forget how terrifying and depressign the second half is.\\n\\nThat shot of the old couple laying on the bed... It destroys me every single time.\\n\\nWhat a wonderful film. Titanic has got to be the best film off ALL time. Everything about the film is amazing. James Cameron did a wonderful job (as usual) at directing and Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet are truly wonderful. The music is beautiful too. (BRILLIANT soundtrack.) Like i have already said Titanic is amazing and it will always stay that way. 20/10 Titanic is a fantastic movie to watch. Although it only got 2 stars when it was on normal tv for the uk. I give this movie 10 out of 10. On April 15th 1912 at 2:20am Titanic was sunk. the movie was made in 1997, i think when in 2012 when it\\'s the 100th anniversary, i think they should put Titanic back in the cinemas to mark the 100th anniversary of the titanic that sunk. This movie is a romantic film, set in the backdrop of the historic sinking of the cruise ship named \"Titanic\". Even if you\\'re not that into romantic movies, this movie still packs enough action and suspense to keep you from falling asleep. The CGI for the time was bleeding-edge and the fact that it was the biggest budget movie ever for its time truly shows. The movie is a spectacle and it\\'s done extremely well.\\n\\nThe performances for Leo de Caprio and Kate Winslet isn\\'t anything special but they still deliver believable performances as does the entire cast.\\n\\nEven more than 20 years later, the movie is still extremely watchable and I honestly can\\'t think of a better portrayal of the historic sinking of this massive ship. From the systematic flooding of the cabins below deck to the breaking and snapping of the entire ship into two pieces, its all done extremely well and it all seems very true-to-fact.\\n\\nOverall an amazing cinematic experience and an even better portrayal of an historic event. The movie made me cry. I was in tears. It\\'s emotional. Titanic is one of the most romantic movies you\\'ll ever see. If you\\'re into romance, then this is the movie for you. \"Romance\" happens to be one of the movie genres. The two main characters were meant for each other. They were in love. It\\'s touching! I wanted them to be together forever. I was mainly interested in the ship: Titanic. It was the biggest ship in the world at that time. The movie depicts it very well. Let\\'s not forget the music in Titanic. It\\'s probably the music which brings you into tears. The movie is very long though. Titanic was the biggest movie in box office. It\\'s an ever popular movie. A lot of people like Titanic. Hi I\\'m Meydi from Indonesia, I am a bigges fan of Titanic movie. It has been more than 50 times I watched this movie, the first time I watched this movie when I was 7 years old on the Indonesian TV program, the porn scene was deleted in my country so that\\'s why I could watched the movie at that young age.\\n\\nEverytime I watched the movie was never bored or sick of it. I enjoy a lot the romance storyline in this movie but there was a biggest mistake on Titanic scene.. The scene that still looks like a computer technique and is a little bad is when the water sucks on the Titanic ship. I could say that the computer technique in this movie is still less than perfect... However, Titanic is a true legend to be remembered for us.. Great job for all of yous! nan Titanic, unlike most PG-13 films, was watchable. Perhaps it was the setting of April, 1912 instead of April, 1997. Although you know how it turns out, it was watchable during it\\'s first half.\\n\\nThe movie begins in the present in which the worst scenes take place, mainly because Bill Paxton is in it, a man I\\'ve hated since seeing him in Twister and his partner played by someone I can\\'t recall. They are oceanographers who meet with Old Rose, played by Gloria Stuart. Old Rose was a survivor of the sinking ship and she tells them the story. Only here, the movie is awful; we get that dreaded PG-13 talk (read other reviews of mine for the description).\\n\\nTo make it short, we get the story of rich teen girl meeting up with the dashing poor boy, who fall in love despite the clashes of stature. We get the usual fluff (King Of The World, etc.), but because it\\'s set in an earlier time frame, it\\'s not as bad.\\n\\nThen, all hell breaks loose, the Titanic hits the iceberg and slowly sinks. Here, the movie becomes an action film, as Rose and Jack (played by Leonardo) try to get off the ship, and onto a life vessel. Here the SFX, are brilliant, they recreate a ship going down in spades, although it would have been nice to have some fish floating around in the boat as the ocean started pouring in.\\n\\nAdmittedly, the movie does its job and I guess Cameron deserved his Oscar and Titanic deserved to be called Best Movie of 1997. Still, this could have been better. Maybe the next remake will rectify it, after all, Bill Paxton or music sung by Celine Dion won\\'t be a part of it... Stuff happens sometimes, boy it does. A couple of underweight\\'s (thin bodies) are able to fall out of the goolish real world. Keep in mind (your\\'re listening to someone that acts like their inside of a coffin all the time). So when I watched this movie someone asked me: hey, why are you staring at the floor? As the person petted someone hair. But what they didn\\'t know is that when rose and jack separated, I did want to convey it somehow. Meanwhile the man in front of me screams like a child and someone had their hand on the back of his neck. James Cameron\\'s (Aliens, The Terminator) Titanic is one of the greatest love stories ever told. This film has a special place in my heart as one of the saddest films to date. The two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, do a truly magnificent job at portraying the two doomed, young lovers Jack and Rose. James Horner\\'s score is probably one of the best scores I have ever heard. The set pieces are absolutely stunning, the Titanic is re-created with authenticity and beauty (the look of the exterior and interior of the ship is amazing). The finale is one of the best I have seen: It\\'s suspenseful and sad. Happy and tragic.\\n\\nThe plot focuses on Jack and Rose. Jack being a poor street boy and Rose being a very rich, engaged women. They both happen to be on the doomed voyage that is the Titanic\\'s. As soon as they meet each other love blossoms and they are both drawn closer and closer together. When the ship hits the iceberg a tale of survival and heart-breaking decisions is brought to life. The supporting cast consists of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Gloria Jones, David Warner and Bill Paxton.\\n\\nMany people hate Titanic because they think it\\'s a corny, overrated love-story thats just an excuse for spending a lot of money (plus it is very cool to hate Titanic). It\\'s far more than that. The love-story is brilliantly told and is very tragic, the ending will have most people in tears. The scenes of the ship\\'s destruction are amazing and very well done. The acting is top notch from everyone. This movie rightly deserved its 11 Oscar wins.\\n\\n5/5 from me. I urge everyone who hasn\\'t seen it to see it. Titanic is an amazing epic of love and nightmares. I don\\'t really like romantic films but this was great and pulled it off. The acting was decent but that doesn\\'t really matter in this movie. This film launched Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s career. James Cameron did great in directing this movie and the rest of the creators. The music made the movie. The theme music of James Cameron and the song by Celine Dion was perfect. That song is extremely famous and I sure like it a lot. The movie was beautiful and very realistic. I haven\\'t seen it in a while but since I\\'ve been writing all of this, I might just want to watch it.\\n\\nHedeen\\'s outlook: 10/10 **** A+ I don\\'t consider romantic drama to be my genre exactly. And since Leonardo DiCaprio was a notorious pretty boy (cast mostly to satisfy teenage girls) expectations were exceptionally low. But i was actually pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nThe story revolves around the poor and artistic Jack and the rich girl Rose. They meet by chance on the Titanic and fall in love. First their love has to stand the test of class difference, then the test of the ship sinking...\\n\\nWhen i say i was pleasantly surprised that of course has to be weighed against the fact that expectations were exceptionally low. But still this is actually a lot more entertaining than i could ever have dreamed it would be. Most of the credit for that i would have to give James Cameron who seldom disappoints. But while this movie does entertain (not least because of very impressive visuals) it\\'s still a very simple and basic story. I guess what it comes down to is expectations. If you expect it to be movie of the century, a deep and sensitive film, you will be sorely disappointed. It is well-made, decently acted, beautifully shot and rather entertaining. As long as you remember what kind of movie you are watching. I rate it 6/10. Titanic is one of the best films made in the 20th century and clearly the best that Cameron has shot. A real block of world cinema, a film that will be known and watched by more than one generation. An excellent disaster film in which the Titanic crash itself is just a decoration. Excellent work on the transfer of the era of the beginning of the 20th century. The magnificent cast, thanks to this film, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet entered the elite of Hollywood. It is difficult to even imagine whether it will be possible to make a disaster film better than Cameron did, in 20 + years no one has chosen for this level. Rounding out a three-way tie for most Academy Award wins, James Cameron\\'s 1997 Best Picture-winning film Titanic, was as massive in scope as the doomed titular White Star liner. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet join together to tell the story of the most well-known nautical disaster of the 20th century. Cameron takes some liberties with the telling of the disaster, largely through the injected romance between a young aristocrat and a struggling artist. The story is told in sweeping Cameron fashion, that he is well known for, through a beautiful juxtaposition of tragedy and doomed courtship.\\n\\nBoarding the luxurious R.M.S. Titanic with her family and fiancÃ©, Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) feels like she is in shackles boarding a slave boat. The beautiful young woman of 17 is being married off to a man that views her as property and a reflection of himself rather than a person to build a life with. Once the ship docks in Philadelphia, Rose is to marry Caledon \\'Cal\\' Hockley (Billy Zane), a wealthy oil businessman in a union arranged by her mother Ruth Dewitt Bukater (Frances Fisher). Rose has no attraction or interest in building a life together with Cal, and their marriage is seen as a way out of the financial difficulty the death of Rose\\'s father has brought to their family. While pondering her future plight along the ship deck, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor vagabond who won his ticket on the liner in a poker game locks eyes with her. Instantly smitten, Jack\\'s new role is to break social barriers and explore a romance with Rose. Jack finally gets his chance when he talks Rose off the ledge of the ship one night when she is consumed by despair over her upcoming nuptials and sees suicide as the only way out. Being invited to dinner with Cal and Rose\\'s family as a gesture of thanks for his being at the right place at the right time, Jack borrows a suit and charms Rose. Knowing how she feels about her life and fiancÃ©, Jack stops at nothing to convince Rose that they can endure a relationship with each other filled with love and the mutual freedom Rose so desires. The story of the doomed love is told through 101-year old Rose after her necklace has been found aboard the sunken wreckage by a team of excavators led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton).\\n\\nTaken at what it is, Titanic is a wonderful film. Cameron beautifully juxtaposes the romance along with the historically accurate depiction of the ship\\'s voyage. The film is heavy on romance, however, and if that\\'s not your preferred genre you will struggle to look past it and focus on the history alone. The film looks as beautiful as it sounds, which is no easy feat given the subject manner. The elegant music accompanies the riches that shine through the set and cinematography in a perfect union. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful in the film and walks the line between boyhood charm and adult charisma that can be counted on quite well. As good as Winslet was in the role, she seemed miscast for the part. Her mature beauty was difficult to accept as a 17-year-old young woman. The chemistry between the two actors, however, was magical, and may be the reason to overlook Winslet not being believable as a teenager. Class and social standings are mainstays of exploration throughout the film. Rose loves art, and Jack is an artist in the time where even Pablo Picasso\\'s works are looked upon as infantile, with Cal proclaiming that he \"will never amount to a somebody\". In a world that only accepts one way to live and one idea to live up to, Jack and Rose can\\'t find a place to fit in, which is only made better by them finding each other; and really, who can\\'t relate to the feeling of being an outsider in the world in which they live? The stage curtains open ...\\n\\nNot since the advent of the 1995 film, \"Braveheart\", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with \"Titanic\". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don\\'t understand) the negative backlash that I\\'ve read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.\\n\\nWe follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she\\'ll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.\\n\\nWhat makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I\\'ve read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn\\'t work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.\\n\\nI highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by \"Titanic\". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again. James Cameron\\'s Titanic was something else. It\\'s amazing to think how this movie came out in 1997. Titanic is a film that many will remember that broke ground. Not just for the actors involved but for filmmaking in general.\\n\\nTitanic is very, very well made. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for James Cameron. He wanted to make this movie special and he has. The amount of research that Cameron had to do to make the film look realistic is evident.\\n\\nThe entire set is a whole world in itself. Cameron\\'s direction transports us to ins and outs of the ship which all look so beautiful. The atmosphere and grandness of the ship sticks with you especially during the inevitable sinking scene where you can feel the terror and panic aboard. The cinematography is pure brilliance. The ship has a very elegant feel and the set design and costumes from the inside also adds to that feeling. Visually, this is one the best looking films of all time.\\n\\nThe acting was sublime all through the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are in top form and have some of the best chemistry in a film ever. Their romance seemed so believable that I never felt bored during it. The supporting cast are also great, especially Billy Zane.\\n\\nI have to give immense praise to James Cameron for handling this film. He took a lot of time researching and working to make this movie the grand spectacle it is and feel as accurate as possible to the real incident. Whilst some think this film is overrated, you cannot deny the sheer effort that went into crafting this movie. You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!\\n\\nKate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece! What can i say of this movie? Its so good ; the actors make the characters very beleivable and we follow them. Its pretty pleasant. And it tell the story, we all know, of the terrible incident of the Titanic. The story about this movie was very good. The \"mise en scene\" make titanic a very pretty different thing and have some memorable moments: the end, the love story(the way they play with each other) and all of this make the movie very pleasant even if the end can be really sad, this movie is very worth it and i recommend it! While I admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked - the film as a whole was awful. Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio\\'s Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo\\'s career in it\\'s tracks, given the \"heartthrob\" title attributed to him. Conversely and inexplicably it boosted Kate\\'s career beyond any explanation. Titanic was/is a very popular film. The story of Titanic is fascinating, which meant that many people wanted to see this movie. This movie could have been one of the best ever made(at least in the genre), if it hadn`t been for Leonardo DiCaprio. I hate DiCaprio, he is a very poor actor, and very nearly destroys this movie. However, the other actors are excellent, it has a solid director on board, and the best soundtrack ever composed. Titanic is also an important movie that every human on earth(at least in Western societies) should see once in their lifetime. 7/10 This movie had great effects, great costumes, and the music still sends shivers down my spine (and I don\\'t mean the song sung by Celine Dion). The sinking scene made me gasp in horror and sadness, because I knew it had to be so much worse for the actual people on the Titanic in 1912. I felt helpless sitting in the theater, and you could see all too well this mammoth tragedy could have been averted.\\n\\nThe acting was overrated. No offense to Leonardo, but I don\\'t think he\\'s a very good actor and I\\'m one of the few young women who doesn\\'t find him very attractive. I didn\\'t think either Jack and Rose were likeable characters (most of the movie, I wanted to smack Rose, who was an obnoxious brat). The drawing scene and sex scene in the car were tasteless and unnecessary. Kathy Bates was wonderful as usual, but the best performance was delivered by Frances Fisher as Ruth. You could tell exactly what she was thinking and she didn\\'t have to say a word.\\n\\nThis was a very good movie but I think it could have been even better. And I think James Cameron\\'s acceptance speech at the Oscars was insulting and embarrassing. Anyway, I liked this movie. It was pretty cool. It had OUTSTANDING special effects, nice love story, OUTSTANDING score, nice song, good performances, FANTASTIC--yet somewhat predictable ending, and a naked Kate Winslet!!!!\\n\\n3(***)out of 4(****)stars James Cameron\\'s Titanic holds up very well indeed after more than ten years since initial release. The minuses now are the same as then but they are minor in comparison to the plusses. First of all, the Titanic is one of the grandest tragedies of human history. The highest and mightiest could tumble. It was an analogy to the state of the world, almost like a foreshadowing of the First World War when all that seemed eternal disintegrated with spectacular suddenness.\\n\\nCameron approaches the task primarily as a hardware technician. The ship looks the way it has to look - grandiose, solid, lavishly appointed. The physical details are spot on, down to the last piece of china. This all helps. The use of CGI during the prolonged sinking is largely state of the art even now.\\n\\nThe idea of putting a story of young lovers at the center of the film is a sound, if trite, way to give us the universal through the particular. The film would have been just as gripping if Cameron had chosen a more Altmanesque approach whereby a whole group of characters would be given more or less equal weight as they made their way to journey\\'s end. Here the focus is on the teenage couple: unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet) and working-class bohemian artiste (Leonardo DiCaprio). The problem with these usually fine actors is that too often their youthful brio seems forced, as if Cameron as director/screenwriter is straining to point out their youth, their vitality, their exuberance, in contrast to Winslet\\'s stuffy social set which disapproves of their alliance. The best acting comes from Billy Zane as the arrogant, sadistic, petulant fiancÃ© of Winslet who stops at nothing to separate her from unwashed upstart DiCaprio. Zane gets it all right, including the clipped prep school accent which barely conceals his primal, frustrated rage at being trumped by someone from the lower classes. DiCaprio comes across as a modern suburban high school student playing a street urchin in a drama class presentation. There is no real edge to him. In fact, if the casting had been reversed it would have made much more sense. But DiCaprio\\'s youth, looks and agility carry him through the spectacle. Besides, we don\\'t go to spectacles for acting nuance.\\n\\nCameron\\'s script isn\\'t as dreadful as some claim, but it has significant shortcomings. (Screenwriting was the only major category in which Titanic was not nominated for an Oscar - and for good reason.) A bit of working over by a competent script doctor would have made it truer. Amazingly, considering Cameron himself has some background in visual arts, the situations and dialogue touching on questions of painting are embarrassingly unimaginative and superficial. And much of the banter between Winslet and DiCaprio sounds late 20th century, not 1912. The conflict between the haughty first-class passengers and those beneath them is perhaps overdone. Frances Fisher is touching as Winslet\\'s socially striving mother for whom we feel both pity and contempt as she pushes her daughter into marriage with a soulless brute. Gloria Stuart as Kate Winslet grown old and Victor Garber as the ship\\'s designer who sees his master creation ripped asunder also stand out. And some of the dinner table conversation in the first-class dining room is elegant and witty.\\n\\nOne implausibility: The water temperature of the sea in which the Titanic sank was just above freezing. No human, save an Olympic athlete, or at least the young and vigorous, could have survived more than a few minutes in waters of that temperature. Survivors relate that the screaming of the passengers who landed in the water when the ship sank subsided after only a few minutes. None could survive the water. Yet Kate Winslet is seen wading neck deep in this ice bath for minutes on end as she struggles to rescue DiCaprio who has been handcuffed to steam pipes in a lower-level cabin. Then the two proceed through endless corridors of freezing water to the deck where they continue on, fighting their way through panicked crowds, breaking down barriers, leaping and scaling heights, etc. until they finally go down with the ship into the freezing sea where they survive for endless minutes more as they as they cling to debris.\\n\\nA CGI flaw: Just as false, occasionally Cameron\\'s keyboard tappers and mouse movers add little puffs of computer-generated condensed breath to accompany the exhalations of actors in close up. Problem is, only intermittently does this condensation appear. One moment you see it, another moment it\\'s gone.\\n\\nThe interminable lovey-dovey blatherings between Winslet and DiCaprio as they float in the ice water quickly wear thin. Perhaps pre-teen girls (a major component of this film\\'s box office) would be transfixed by this interlude, but surely most adults would be yearning for DiCaprio\\'s character to die and get it over with.\\n\\nAnd even more dreadful than everything cited above is the treacly \"Our Love Will Go On,\" a pop song belted by Celine Dion over the closing credits. I am sick and tired of contemporary pop songs being tacked on to historical dramas.\\n\\nFinally, the ultimate film to see on this subject is \"Titanic: The Legend Lives On\" (1994), a fascinating and moving 4-hour-plus Arts & Entertainment Channel documentary about the Titanic from conception through construction through destruction, aftermath and cultural/historical legacy. More emotionally involving and fascinating than Cameron\\'s movie. It will stay with you for a long time. This is just a record breaker and you can see why. Even to this day I find anything Titanic related really interesting,. Such a great movie. nan nan James Cameron\\'s \"Titanic\" is a masterpiece. This is a brilliant film from start to finish. It\\'s exciting, romantic, and never boring. I\\'m usually not a fan of movies that run over 3 hours long, but this is arguably my favorite 3 hour plus movie because it goes by fast. A year before this movie came out, CBS aired their two-part movie based on the 1912 sinking of the ship that was dubbed \"unsinkable\". It was O.K., but the 1997 theatrical film made the TV version look real flat by comparison. I\\'ve always had a fascination with the Titanic disaster, and this movie presents its depiction of the doomed ship in a frightening way. When I saw this movie the first time, at times I felt like I was on the Titanic. It\\'s that good. Splendid acting, remarkable special effects, and masterful storytelling, this is a movie that I\\'ll never forget.\\n\\n**** (out of four) There isn\\'t much that can be said about James Cameron\\'s Titanic that hasn\\'t been said by the cast & crew, the audiences or the hours upon hours of bonus content that accompanies every release of the film for the last 15 years.\\n\\nTitanic is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The sets are gorgeous and look exactly like the images of the Titanic, James Horner\\'s score perfectly compliments the stunning visuals and tone throughout the film, the acting (particularly, of course, from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) is second to none, the camera work James Cameron does throughout the movie helps to make the movie feel truly epic and heartbreaking. It\\'s a perfectly balanced film that features a spontaneous love connection (with the chemistry to match it), but also doesn\\'t take away from the truly tragic elements of the Titanic.\\n\\nIt\\'s a movie that is both sensationalized to suit Hollywood and the film-going public of its time and sensitive to the reality of its subject matter when it needs to be. It\\'s like there\\'s a switch that is flipped, as soon as the very real and horrific events of the Titanic begin to transpire on the screen, it switches to a reflection of the tragedy of the time in a respectful manner. The love and admiration James Cameron has for the ship is extremely evident as the film goes on, and he managed to craft a perfectly balanced story.\\n\\nIt\\'s an endearing film and a great way to ensure that the public always remembers what happened on the RMS Titanic. Of all the film adaptations (live-action and animated) that exist, this one is definitely the definitive, go-to version. It holds your interest with its perfect pacing and leaves you on the edge of your seat. When I first saw this movie the day it opened, I was going in because I liked the cast, I like James Cameron\\'s work, I was blown away by trailer, and I prefer not to judge a movie by its budget. I am not a fanatic about the actual ship; my reaction has always been, \"It\\'s a big ship, it sank. So what?\" Back on opening day, though some rave reviews had already come out, some dissenting views had also come, and while interest was expected, no one knew the ultimate fate of the movie. And at the theater I saw it in, the projector broke down three times in the first five minutes, and I think it\\'s safe to say the audience I saw it with was ready to kill. Then, finally, the movie went on interrupted.\\n\\nBy the end, though we of course took the free passes the theater provided us to apologize for our inconvenience, we were transfixed by what we had seen on screen. James Cameron is a director who tries here to make art out of pure entertainment, and he suceeds on a massive scale. There were better movies in 1997(TITANIC was #8 on my top ten list that year; the first seven were, in order, THE SWEET HEREAFTER, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, THE ICE STORM, ULEE\\'S GOLD, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, and GROSSE POINTE BLANK), but this was the best pure entertainment of the year. The physical achievement of the movie, of course, is not to be forgotten, particularly when the ship sinks, and the scene where Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose(Kate Winslet) are standing in the front of the boat (the \"I\\'m flying!\" scene), which, when I saw it in the trailer, was what made me want to see the movie. But the love story worked for me as well, as did the wrap-around story of the old Rose (Gloria Stuart) remembering when she was in \"the heart of the ocean.\" DiCaprio is a good actor, and he\\'s good here, though a bit too modern for me, but it\\'s Winslet who gives the movie its heart, playing passion to the hilt.\\n\\nBut as the 70\\'s were the \"Me\" Decade, and the 80\\'s were the \"Greed\" Decade, the 90\\'s can probably best be described as the \"Backlash\" Decade. As soon as a work or artist in popular culture (American anyway) becomes popular, it seems people have a felt need to line up and dump on it simply because a lot of other people like it, and they can\\'t stand it. This is not to say all popular culture is good. Rather, it is to argue that just because a lot of people like something doesn\\'t automatically make it bad. This is not the movie of the year, the decade, or the century, but it\\'s a great movie, and I wish people would get over themselves and not consider those of us who feel like I do cretins. This will stand the test of time. After seeing this movie years ago at the cinema I thought it was one of the worst movies of all time (as far as major studio pictures go). Thinking about it before posting up a review here, maybe I was a bit too harsh.\\n\\nIn short, this story is a fictional tale of two star-crossed lovers on board a real life, famous ship (the \"Titanic\") that sank, killing a great percentage of its passengers and crew (um, sorry if that is a spoiler, but sheesh, you SHOULD know that!).\\n\\nWhen I am feeling particularly unkind about this film, some of my criticisms are: only director James Cameron could look at the story of the Titanic and think \"Hmmm. That story could make a good movie...IF ONLY IT HAD MORE DRAMA!\". Yeah, sinking ship, hundreds dead, needs MORE drama!\\n\\nAnother peeve about this movie is how Cameron can\\'t resist manipulating our sympathies to characters by resorting to melodrama and crudely drawn characters who we find easy to hate, in order to have us rooting for other characters. E.g. Billy Zane\\'s character of Hockley. Didn\\'t quite throw a chihuahua into the ice-cold ocean, but nasty enough to do everything short of this. Really, a more sophisticated script could have made him a figure deserving of our sympathy too.\\n\\nA minor peeve is how one of those star crossed lovers, Kate Winslet\\'s Rose, is quite prescient and insightful about the ship\\'s situation...just didn\\'t seem very plausible for one so young and unschooled in such matters.\\n\\nDespite thinking this movie one of the all time stinkers (for a major studio release) I did, at the time, think it a master-stroke to have the two star-crossed lovers at the centre of this tale (Kate Winslet\\'s \"Rose\" and Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s \"Jack\"). It is just a brilliant device in order to hook you and reel you into this great historical drama/tragedy. Again, it was a great pity that Cameron chose not to make a victim of people like Hockley as well, instead of demonising him. And it\\'s not as if Cameron didn\\'t have alternatives in his own script. For instance, Jack\\'s sketching of Rose could have provided a more believable foundation on which to base a relationship on instead of the hysterical melodrama Cameron resorts to to get them together.\\n\\nPerhaps the time-frame of the sinking made melodrama necessary.Truly spectacular but deserved Razzies for things like script and direction.\\n\\nDespite my criticisms, when Titanic eventually hits the ice-berg, the movie is an absolute thrill ride and quite exhilarating.\\n\\nP.S. must put in a word for the great Australian song by Flash and the Pan \"Down among the dead men\". It\\'s not in this movie (Celine Dion does the theme song), but the Flash and the Pan song is actually about the Titanic and is a brilliant pop song...beautiful too. Look it up on You Tube. The problem with these iconic blockbusters that worm their way in to culture, is that their lasting image burned in to my brain is one of the fan culture, the parodies, the awards, the ripple of films influenced for decades after, and the legacy of the filmmakers and the technology going forwards, all which overshadow the actual merits of the film itself and eventually taint it in my mind; almost like a kind of warped reverse/retconned-hype.\\n\\nTitanic is an elegant harmony of period drama and destruction porn. With a 70/30 split of the action in the back-end like theatre. Managing to weave his underwater interests in to a tragic love story in a Shakespeare vein gives it a quintessential classical Hollywood feel. There\\'s some cheesy acting and dialogue but it\\'s all in keeping with the blockbuster ethos; Cameron\\'s on-the-nose dialogue (clearly trumped up by ghost-writers here) fits the classic nature of the film and produces some memorable, quotable lines.\\n\\nCameron clearly knows wonder and spectacle, but also attention to detail and minutiae; the examinations of the microcosm of class, the revelry in such feats of engineering and artistry. Titanic, adopting a sublimely classic structure, manages a marriage of all these elements very well. It jumps through time elegantly, crossing over tacitly also in to excavation drama and faux-biopic.\\n\\nThere\\'s a tangible (read: expensive) earthy quality to the authentically constructed sets and meticulous and completely fashionable costumes. And the superb editing enhances the tactile nature of the film. Cameron really knows pacing in this film; always paced just right, never languid, never passing over the important moments, almost no scene that doesn\\'t serve a purpose; the film\\'s breathing room allows for many callbacks and twists and turns and it can be genuinely tense at times. Again, elegance is the word that comes to mind, a perfect synthesis on shooting and editing style and subject matter.\\n\\nThe audio has real range depending on where the characters are standing, I noticed archways or covered areas changing the aural landscape and it\\'s got some properly wistful and hummable music (which you want in the theme) even if the music sometimes sounds like the start of the Home Alone theme, or whatever other Christmas move I kept seeing in my head when the music began.\\n\\nThe picture is superb. In fact it may be the best I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s a pristine image that looks like you\\'re perring through the cleanest window you\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s a masterclass in image reconstruction. The lighting is also lovely, timeless, pretty but not too saccharine, the night shots still impressive. The 3D is cautious but sumptuous. Never gratuitous and never party to ghosting or too many jarring planes of 3D image intersecting. It\\'s clear that Cameron was always interested in framing his shots with many layers which lends itself perfectly for this kind od post-post-conversion. There\\'s a mirror shot featuring Billy Zane and his Manservant that exhibit the quality of the original shooing and the 3D conversion all at once.\\n\\nThe effects still hold up, some are noticeable but not as jarring as some techniques used a decade later. At this time, effects; visual and special, motion capture, matte paintings, miniatures and CGI were all used and blended only when it would have looked its best, represented the best intention of the director. Watching the extras of Titanic alongside the extras of The Hobbit it\\'s depressing how these effects work, particularly mocap and CGI that is now used largely to cut corners on set, or make up for a lack of script, or to cut costs.\\n\\nIn terms of acting, DiCaprio solidifies himself as a charming but cool, real and tangible loveable young tyke, his believable, youthful, effortless acting a joy to watch. Winslet goes through the best arc; her character perfectly embodying both the uptight and the energy of youth, she has real nuance and layers that come out of her character. But it\\'s Zane that I love the most. He\\'s superbly hilarious, watching him a riot, an actor understanding his role perfectly. I am fascinated by Zane who plays a man perfectly from his time; the relaxed air of privilege. He\\'s not mean or evil, he just has edge; he\\'s just exactly a product of the time and his class. He\\'s not even a bad sport, with a knowing sense of humour and a desperate human element.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Titanic is a film that I couldn\\'t see it that often, but when I\\'ve forgotten the clichÃ©s and the well studied beats of it, it\\'s a surprising film of great technical prowess, with gravitas and charm by the bucket-load. It\\'s memorable and a brilliant synthesis of themes and genres. It is expertly crafted cinema in the traditional sense. And in light of recent massive, world-altering tragedies it even takes on new light and new importance as a very raw and emotional product. Mills & Boon on a boat. Still love Leonardo though! Well, if you are reading this, HOW IS THE WEATHER ON MARS? You see, in the early 20th century, there was this boat that sank...well you know.... This movie is the #1 highest grossing movie of all time, as well it should be! I was going over some of the other reviews, and there were a lot of you who said this movie was very bad. Well, I\\'ll tell you what, give me your address, and I will buy you the glasses you obviously need! Watch it again, and you will clearly see the greatest love story of all time coupled with some top notch special effects. Casting Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson was a great idea, but when I heard that someone named Kate Winslet would be the love interest, I said \"Who?\" Well, after seeing her in the movie she filled the role of an early 20th century woman. Great costumes added to the perfection of this movie! Titanic opens with Brock Lovett (Paxton) and his crew as they begin to dive down 12,500 feet to the wreckage of the R.M.S. Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Sea on April 15, 1912. The movie jumps from present day, to the day of that ill-fated voyage, then returns to the present day. That unfortunate day begins with Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) winning a ticket to ride the Titanic back to America where he is from. While on board, he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), a woman being forced to marry a man she does not love. While on board, Jack and Rose develop a loving relationship, and spend all their time together hiding their feelings from all those who oppose. Titanic follows the two as they fall in love, evade the jealous ex-fiancÃ©, Cal Hockley (Zane), and eventually watch as their very short time begins to come to an end due to the sinking of the great Titanic. Of the many characters that went through changes in Titanic, I chose to discuss Rose DeWitt Bukater, and why she represents a three-dimensional character. When we first are introduced to Rose, we get the impression that she is a little `rich bitch.\\' She pulls up on the boarding dock in a caravan of new cars, welding a barrage of luggage. When she first lays eyes upon Jack, who is on the lower deck with the rest of the `commoners\\', she has already formed her inferior opinion of him. It is not until Jack stumbles onto Rose attempting to leap from the aft of the Titanic, and saves her, does she begin to realize that he is not inferior, and instead an interesting man. Rose soon begins to fall in love with Jack, and this is where we see her change from that `rich bitch\\' to a caring, lovable woman. We later find out that even though she let go of Jack by the end of the film, she carried the memory of him her entire life through the beautiful necklace she wore as Jack sketched her portrait. Titanic is filled with irony, symbolism, and conflict. The fact the Jack Dawson won his ticket to ride on Titanic, only to perish on it\\'s very first voyage, is the first taste of irony that we experience. Also, how heartbreaking is it that just after finding true love, they are split by the death of Jack? Tragic. The greatest use of symbolism in Titanic occurs within the scene where Jack attends the dinner with Rose, Cal, and others. This represents the life that Rose is bound to, and desperately seeking to escape. The opposite happens when Jack takes Rose down to the lower deck, and we witness Rose expressing her most comfortable, newfound personality. We also cannot forget the use of the diamond necklace. The necklace ultimately represents Roses\\' undying love for Jack, which she has held onto all her life. Only after she visits the wreckage of the Titanic is she finally ready to let go, and subsequently releases the necklace to the sea, and passes on in her sleep. As with many of James Cameron\\'s films, Titanic uses numerous close up shots to convey intimacy. A perfect example of this occurs in the scene when Jack is drawing the nude form of Rose. Another technique that I feel James Cameron has mastered is the use of sound and/or music in his films. A right sound effect, or musical score as in Titanic, helps to complete that scary slasher scene, or that sad death scene, or even that scene where words just cannot express the right feeling as in that beautiful scene in Titanic when the lifeboat is being lowered with Rose inside. The film Titanic is such that in my opinion could be considered as having both a realistic and romantic ending. The fact that Jack Dawson died at the end makes it a realistic ending; while having Rose walking to the rear of the ship to toss the ever symbolic diamond necklace into the night darkened sea creates the feeling of a romantic ending. Titanic proves to not only push the envelope, but break it wide open with the masterful direction by James Cameron. While Titanic\\'s photography would reason to be realistic, it is by all accounts formalist. The use of distorted camera angles, wide-angle shots, and camera movements make it such. As I earlier stated, the use of a great musical score in any film will make, or break that particular feeling the director wishes to convey. It is said that realists films employ minimal musical scores, while formalist films come with big scores that are hard to ignore. Titanic not only has the critically acclaimed `My Heart Will Go On\\' theme song, but many beautiful scores such as `Rose\\' and `Southampton\\' which, in this reviewers opinion, is the main reason this movie was as beautiful as it really was.\\n\\nCostuming for Titanic was definitely elaborate and by itself is another reason this film is considered a formalist film. Lastly, the way the story and characters unfold is widely considered formalistic. Formalist films are ones with courageous heroes (Jack) and beautiful women (Rose). The story in Titanic took place on the biggest and most prestigious ocean liner ever built, which coincides with the fact that formalist films take place in exotic settings. The only inconsistency that I have encountered with James Cameron\\'s Titanic being measured a formalist film is the fact that it could be said that the film contains two different endings. The first, by definition, could be considered realist because Jack Dawson ultimately died after the sinking. Since the older Rose was shown tossing the necklace into the sea, achieving a final internal peace and showing that she is ready to let go and join Jack in the afterlife, it is my opinion this proves that it has a happy ending and hence should be referred to as formalist. nan This movie is not great, its just OK, especially considering that it won so many awards, and was directed by James Cameron, whose made several masterpieces(both Terminators, Aliens, and The Abyss), which were all much, much better than this. This film had several flaws, overlength, sucky acting(Leonardo that\\'s you) to name a few. When I think of a James Cameron film, I think of heart-pounding thrills, and a little bit of blood to add a little extra interest. It just annoys me how James Cameron is known for this movie, when his other movies were so much better, especaially the criminalally underrated \"The Abyss\". This film is worth watching, but it is no where near a masterpiece. *** out of *****. the contemporary storyline involves American treasure-seeker Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) retrieving artifacts from the submerged ship. Lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman, nude except for a necklace. When 102-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) reveals she\\'s the person in the portrait, she is summoned to the wreckage site to tell her story of the 56-carat diamond necklace and her experiences of 84 years earlier. The scene then shifts to 1912 Southampton where passengers boarding the Titanic include penniless Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), returning to Philadelphia with her wealthy fiancÃ© Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). After the April 10th launch, Rose develops a passionate interest in Jack, and Cal\\'s reaction is vengeful. At midpoint in the film, the Titanic slides against the iceberg and water rushes into the front compartments. Even engulfed, Cal continues to pursue Jack and Rose as the massive liner begins its descent.. I have watched Titanic how many times I don\\'t know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors\\' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; \\'My Heart Will Go On\\' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses\\' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie\\'s factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece. This is one of the best movies I\\'ve ever seen. Everything about it was EXCELLENT. The James Cameron really did a good job on this movie. The music was so beautiful. The plot was so touching and sweat. The character are excellently written. I don\\'t know anything about this movie that I don\\'t like. I recommend this movie to anyone who like a really good romance story. This is the most beautiful movie ever made. nan This story is the only one that can share the words interesting and sad, as for the movie its amazing. I would definately recommend checking this movie out it is a sad one but does have some incredible moments.\\n\\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are the stars and they done a great job.\\n\\nHighly Recommend. This movie right here is \"Overrating\" in its prime.\\n\\n\"The most compelling movie of the century\". That\\'s a joke.\\n\\nMy question is: Why? Why Cameron? Why did you do it??? You\\'re WAY better than this! But, since Cameron created some cinematic masterpieces like \"The Terminator\" and \"Aliens\", I\\'m willing to let this one slide. You got lucky this time, Cameron.\\n\\nThis movie was nothing but one misplaced drama scene after another. And it wasn\\'t like you could sit through them easily either, this movie was more than 3 hours long! I understand that a lot of people liked this movie, and that maybe I\\'m being biased, but I really did not like this \"garbage\".\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, there were some very good scenes, and some music score that was decent. But the tear jerker moments grew tiresome quickly. Why are Billy Zane and Bill Paxton wasting their time here? Good scenes and some interesting plot points could not save this mess of a bad drama. I\\'m sorry, but this Hollywood trash reeks and stains the true story of the Titanic, almost to the point of disgracing it.\\n\\nIf you like too much drama and romance badly put together with bad acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, \"Titanic\" is what you want.\\n\\n4/10 Beautiful to look it, and easy to watch over again, but not necessarily a great film. It is pretty good - mostly because the last 90 minutes or so are fantastic cinema - but it\\'s not particularly well-written or well-acted. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the acting is not that impressive, though that could be due to the dialogue more than the actors. The story is simple enough, but carried out pretty well, and the look of the film is outstanding. All the technical aspects are top-notch, making for a thrilling last half. The first half is no slouch either, though, and I felt the film transitioned nicely from love story to disaster epic. All in all, an entertaining but slightly underwhelming epic. I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful tale of forbidden love set on history\\'s most famous ocean liner, and believe both the film and its engaging and sympathetic young lovers will go down in the annals of screen legend. All the hype turned out to be a prediction of the movie\\'s calibre, as far as I\\'m concerned, though some have described it as the movie \"many love to hate\".\\n\\nOf course the film chronicles the tragically brief shipboard romance between Rose, a beautiful, confused young socialite (traveling First Class of course), who is engaged to a suitable but nasty fiancÃ© of her social status, and Jack, the penniless, free spirited young artist traveling in steerage, Third Class. The lead roles are brilliantly portrayed, with electric chemistry, by the lovely Kate Winslet and the dashing young Leonardo diCaprio, both made famous by their roles here. (Pity diCaprio went on to do that foolish modern Romeo + Juliet, a desecration.)\\n\\nAs for the romance...yes, it\\'s a moving tale that will endure along with other screen legends. The weaving of the tale of the diamond necklace, the Heart of the Ocean, and Jack\\'s sketch of Rose are interesting story lines. When disaster strikes the ill fated ship, the struggles of Rose and Jack to stay alive are truly gripping. The film\\'s romantic song, \"My Heart Will Go On\", is of course legendary, though I personally am not a tremendous fan of Celine Dion.\\n\\nThis movie is not, from my perspective, a historical documentary and I don\\'t take it as such. My knowledge of Titanic history is pretty sketchy, and it wouldn\\'t surprise me if the film contains a few, some, or even many inaccuracies. Still, for me the picture brought to life the spectacle of the extravagant luxury aboard this liner (decor, dining, passengers\\' attire etc.), the smug, complacent assurance that the ship was unsinkable, the tragedy and surely, eventual terror as the passengers struggled with the inadequate life boats provided and the great White Star liner sank... albeit despite the early refusal to contemplate such a fate, and the band eventually bravely playing on. The final scenes are haunting, hardly a dry eye in the theatre. I feel the fictional romance is interwoven well with the historical details to produce a film that elicits compassion for the unfortunate real victims back in 1912 and would not offend them, were they able to watch it today.\\n\\nThe class distinctions are also wonderfully conveyed. One reviewer has complained that the film belabors the greater integrity and friendliness of the lower class, casting the upper class generally in a less flattering light. However, historically let us remember that the lower class passengers were the primary victims, so they would naturally tend to elicit the film makers\\' (and viewers\\') sympathies.\\n\\nAll in all, an amazing modern spectacle based on a tragic historical event, a touching love story, and overall, a fantastic film. Titanic is the most famous \"fictional story tied into real event\" movie to date. It tells the story of a poor man who wins tickets to board the Titanic in a poker game. He and his friend board the ship in hopes of reaching New York City and starting life anew. While on board, he falls for a rich woman who is set to be married. After he saves her life, she begins to fall for him, and a passionate love story begins. However, their plans are halted abruptly when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink. Now it\\'s a race against time to try and get off the ship as soon as possible.\\n\\nI don\\'t care what anyone has to say about this movie. Sure, the first hour is chick flick material, and it features the clichÃ©d rich girl/poor boy formula, but this movie is so well made, well acted, and well directed, that it deserves all the praise it gets. The movie has a 3 hour running time, but it\\'s never really slow. Even in the sappy scenes, you\\'re drawn in by the amazing set around the characters. James Cameron did a great job directing this movie. The recreation of the interior of the Titanic is amazing. It\\'s like they\\'re filming inside the real ship. Though the first hour is mainly a love story, it still can keep the guys entertained because it\\'s not a long drawn out drama. Cameron keeps amazing balance between continuing the love story and telling the story of the disaster in the second half of the film. The sinking scenes are fantastic. Finally, the most accurate portrayal of the Titanic\\'s demise on film. This movie has drama, action, and some comedy. It manages to tell a great story and be a highly entertaining action film at the same time.\\n\\nThe performances are very good. Not one performance in this movie is flawed. Everybody involved is extremely talented and they all do very well in their parts.\\n\\nOverall, despite what anyone says about this movie, it doesn\\'t change the fact that it\\'s an epic film with a great story and amazing visuals.\\n\\n9/10 It isn\\'t the romantic tale of rich girl-poor boy ingrained into many hearts due to Kate & Leo and it isn\\'t the recreation of history with poetic license.... It\\'s making me believe I\\'m seeing that ship sink every time I watch. Kudos to James Cameron, with a nod to the frightening Francis Fisher as the aristocratic Mother pimping out her daughter and Billy Zane whom without his sneer Titanic wouldn\\'t have sailed so far. I\\'ll put up with Leo calling out \"Rose, Rose\" another thousand times to again watch this disaster movie with the romantic hook. A Night To Remember tells the straight tale, but Titanic is certainly personalized with Camerons\\' storytelling. I\\'m pretty sure that most people who strongly argue that this film sucks are merely determined to not liking it. Not that I don\\'t see their points. The dialogue is fairly stupid, and the characters are pretty stereotypical. But that doesn\\'t alter the fact that it\\'s probably one of the grandest films of all time, and to spite you non-believers, I might add that it will become a classic, much like Gone with the Wind - and there\\'s nothing you can do about it...\\n\\nThe performance of Winslet and DiCaprio lifts the dialogue, and the entire scenery is so magnificent there\\'s none to match it. As for detail and Cameron\\'s eye for excesses, I don\\'t think there was one single penny lost to this film. All of it bears a sensation of reality that is just WAY above anything else I\\'ve encountered.\\n\\nI\\'ve enjoyed Cameron\\'s films for several years, and it saddens me to think that this man had to make a drama (albeit the best of dramas) to be recognized as the great director he is. I long for his next project.\\n\\nAnd to those few who hasn\\'t seen it yet: please don\\'t listen to your friends who didn\\'t like it: think for yourselves! I used to be one of those who absolutely were not interested in seeing the movie but as it was on telly I decided to watch anyway...and look how wrong I am, I even gave it 4 stars.... Now the story itself is one without surprises as after all it\\'s about a boat that hit an iceberg and I knew before that it\\'s the kind of movie at where housewives are searching for handkerchiefs but the truth is that James Cameron (the Terminatorman) has used all Hollywoodcliches in the best way that can be used... The special effects are enormous and the interaction between Leonardo and Kate is one of a rare breed (and no I am not a Leonardo-fan at all...). Perhaps the whole thing was a bit too commercialised (but so was \"Gone with the wind\") and it\\'s not the best movie ever and even 11 Oscars was a bit too much but absolutely worth 4 hours of your life. TITANIC LEO and KATE or WINSLET are wearing each other in their friendship. It is two decades but still, romantic. The movie with LEO prior to winning his OSCAR for BEST ACTOR is the unlike event of it happening to us. We are not sailors but we need them and they need us to be present. Sailing on a boat or a ship like in \"LIFE IN THE MISSISSIPI\" is a waste of valued coal but the steam engine that crossed those days disappeared as well. nan This movie is *pitiful.* It is *abominable*. In terms of dung heaps, it is second only to \"Superman Returns.\" That\\'s not a very honorable position.\\n\\nWhy do I hate \"Titanic,\" you may be wondering? Here\\'s a list. 1) Leonardo di Caprio\\'s performance as the lovable but down-on-his-luck guy could have been played better and more realistically by Paris Hilton. 2) Kate Winslet\\'s fake American accent is the least of the woes left by her whiny, I\\'m-a-poor-widdle-rich-girl turn. 3) James Cameron should automatically be disqualified as the director of any real historical tragedy, because he makes us care more about the prettiness of the ship than the victims. 4) Where James Horner\\'s music fails to nauseate (he was really off his game here), you always have the classic fallback: Celine Dion\\'s mess of a theme song.\\n\\nThose are the top four reasons-- I could write a 52-page essay on why this movie is so horrid, but IMDb doesn\\'t provide reviewers with that kind of space, so I\\'ll condense it a wee bit.\\n\\nIf you want to watch a disaster, this film is perfect... and I\\'m referring to the debacle of the film, not the Titanic incident. nan nan I can never get enough of it! It is thrilling, touching, heartbreaking, and romantic with a powerful soundtrack you will never forget. Watch Titanic for the best cathartic cry of your life. nan Remember the world\\'s most heartbreaking moment, the sinking of the Titanic? Well, memories come back to us when the incredible James Cameron and his big imagination create a powerful love story disaster. The film is a fictional love story, taking place in a historical event. Set to the sinking of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a poor man named Jack, who falls in love with a rich woman named Rose, portrayed by Kate Winslet. Although separated by the number of money in their pockets, that does not stop the love between each other. Then, when Titanic begins to sink, sacrifices are being made, and Jack would do anything in his power to make Rose safe. James Cameron let out his heart into this movie, and really wanted to express his feelings on the sinking. Though the film is sad, and maybe too graphic, the film was a beautiful masterpiece portrayed by an amazing cast, a great direction, an amazing re-creation of history, brilliant costumes, breathtaking art direction, scene-stealing sound effects, visionary film editing, and exhilarating visual effects. I watch the movie over and over again and never got tired of enjoying it, cause it will never leave your heart. I\\'ll never forget watching this movie, and I\\'ll respect that it won the Best Picture on my birth year, and glad it made a billion dollars in the box office. This movie will always be epic and romantic in every way. This is a visual marvel, but it also has great characters and a terrific story to go along with it. \"Titanic\", in my review, \"a beautiful masterpiece of the heart, something to enjoy watching over and over.\"\\n\\nOh, and speaking of the 3D re-release, it\\'s worth your money! Even if this movie was made in 1997, James Cameron is one of those filmmakers that knows how to make perfect use of the 3-D, and he makes it look like the movie was made in 3-D. Even if you wish that James Cameron should have cut the film 20 minutes shorter, you still believe that every single detail that James Cameron added, had to be there in the movie. The 3-D literally draws you into the adventure, frankly because this is the type of 3-D that is used perfectly, just like in \"Avatar\". So, go out and watch it again in the special 3-D treatment! nan Waited as long as possible before watching this thing to let the public fanfare fade away, then one night, fell exhausted on ye olde couch with naught else to view... & phew...it was far worse even than expected. Where to start? Acting? Where? Corny? Hey, Iowa aint got this much in a year. Shallow? A nickel couldn\\'t have sunk in this thing. One word summation? EMBARRASSING. Ironic that Heavens Gate was same kind of film but beautifully made & was an all-time disaster, whereas this pig was a big hit. Ah well, god bless the new economy & remember PT Barnum. Since I have commented on over 100 movies, my collection may not seem complete without a comment for the grandest, biggest, most expensive and highest grossing film of all time. You either loved it or hated it, it was one of the films like \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"Fargo\" (which I loved both, by the way), and I know why everyone talked about it for months on end. It is a grand film. It isn\\'t my favorite movie of all time (Some Like It Hot takes that title), but it is worthy of a place on my video shelf. Kate Winslet gives a powerful performance as Rose, and Leo DiCaprio is very good as well. I\\'m not one of those girls who swoons over him, but some of his movies have been enjoyable including \"Gilbert Grape\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\". Kate was wonderful in \"Heavenly Creatures\" and \"Sense and Sensibility\" and she has become of of my favorite actresses because her roles are given from the heart, she puts her best effort into her acting. I must confess that I bought the movie the day that it came on video and have only watched it a few other times. While I do enjoy the film very much, I am glad that the hype has died down. The effects and sets are Oscar-winning and for a reason, you will never see a boat bigger than this one! A great job by all, although many may view it as a chick flick (hey, my mother loved it too!). If you can spare three hours, check it out or watch it again. \"I\\'ll never let go, I promise\". Neither as good or as bad as the hype might have led me to believe.\\n\\nThe love story is good and the special effects are good, but considering the material Cameron was working with he didn\\'t really produce anything that another director might have with a similarly astronomical budget or possibly a whole lot less.\\n\\nThis is definitely a film for the big screen or at least the biggest screen you have. \"Titanic\" (1997), okay, before you all freak out and get enraged, I will say this. James Cameron has a boatload of talent (NO PUN INTENDED), as a writer and a director. He has written and directed some phenomenal films! But, \"Titanic\" in my opinion, is by far his worst movie. It has an overlong and convoluted storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a dull cliched soundtrack. This \"film\" is 195 minutes in length. Now, the length of a movie can make or break it. I don\\'t mind a long movie if the storyline keeps me hooked all the way through. The basic plot behind this \"film\" is that there\\'s a love story and the Titanic sinks. A simple story like this should warrant 100-120 minutes max to express the storyline. Film Making 101: if you\\'re planning on making a lengthy film, then you better be sure that you know what you\\'re doing. Just because a movie is long, does not always guarantee it\\'s going to be good. Remember the cardinal rule: less is more! You always want to leave your audience asking for more in the end. Therefore, your storyline will have a stronger impact. As for the acting, it\\'s overall disappointing from all of the actors and actresses. However, there are two standouts though. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose are the only two that seem to actually be trying. Both of them are great actors! But, a poorly written storyline impeded them from truly giving it their all and allowing them to shine. Such a shame! Both of these two actors, along with the majority of the rest of the cast are great actors and actresses in other movies. What\\'s their excuse here? Finally, the soundtrack is just a cliched, dull and predictable mess. However, there is one standout song from the score that isn\\'t too bad. The song, \"My Heart Will Go On\" written by James Horner and then performed by Celine Dion is actually well-done. As for the rest of the music in this \"film\", it\\'s just generic and boring. There are only two positives in this \"movie\", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. The Titanic set is very well constructed and the rest of the locations give this \"film\" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects were well-done and still hold up today. \"Titanic\" is a boring and lengthy \"movie\". Probably one of the worst things about it is that you know what\\'s going to happen in the end right from the beginning. Talk about spoiling your own film! Sorry, James Cameron..... \"Titanic\" is just nothing but a jumbled mess. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Don\\'t bother watching \"Titanic\", I don\\'t care how much a film makes at the box office. Just because a movie makes a lot of money doesn\\'t always mean it\\'s automatically going to be a masterpiece. Awards mean nothing, because at the end of the day, what\\'s most important is what you think. I just wish I could get those 195 minutes of my life back! Titanic was such a wonderful movie!!! It accurately portrayed how the ship sunk to begin with. The storyline behind it all including the CAST!!! A+++ Film James Cameron\\'s masterpiece a movie that has Almost everything in it love romance Heroism and sacrifice and unbridled Evil. And the best part most of it is true. Cameron\\'s Titanic is a fictional story told from the most part between two tragic lovers Rose Dewitt and Jack Dawson. Winslet and Decaprio deliver career making performances here. I had been impressed with Decaprio from What\\'s eating Gilbert Grape and discovered this young man can act He stole a movie from Johnny Depp not a easy thing to do. But anyways. Rose is going to be forced into a loveless marriage to a heartless millionaire wonderfully played in a sleazy manner by Billy Zane. Rose\\'s Mother was once married to a man who was once Rich but spent all the money and Died on them leaving them only a name some social connections and a mountain of debt. So Rose must marry a detestable man for his money. In fact once they reach America they will be married. Jack Dawson is a drifter and a dreamer who goes where the wind blows him and the wind gives him a ticket to the third class passenger section of Titanic. Jack is a artist who cares for the adventure of life. Things happen when he rescues Rose from a suicide attempt and she introduces him to her world and discovers they will not make a place for Jack in their world he is beneath them. Jack introduces her to his world and she discovers people who are dirt poor but Rich in other ways They are so alive and vibrant and she discovers within herself the strength to move beyond matters of wealth and social standing. However Rose\\'s Mother and her groom to be have discovered that Rose has fallen for Jack and all their planning in now in danger. Then comes the unthinkable the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to flood. The Captain is given the dire news in an hour all of this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. the news is met with horror skeptics scoff at the idea of the unsinkable Titanic sinking and the people are now drawn into battles of classes first class passengers first all others after. Jack and Rose struggle to survive the death of Titanic and to try to find some meaning after the ship has died and gone down to the bottom of the ocean. There is a beginning story that frames the entire movie involving men and women diving on Titanic looking for treasure and getting involved with old Rose who tells the story. But the Real story here is Cameron\\'s dedication to detail he spent fives years diving on the Titanic and interviewing survivors his quest for accuracy was an obsession that paid off Big. I took my wife to see this movie back when it had just been released and I groaned thru the romance and I laughed at the end when Dicaprio\\'s Heroic Jack Dawson makes a big sacrifice in fact my wife called me a caveman with no feelings. However 13 years later I saw the film on TV again and watched it from the beginning and I Caught all of it. And I understood it better now that all the hype has died down and the Cult of Decaprio has quietly gone away that this movie is a human tragedy and that love knows no boundaries and that somethings should always be remembered no matter how painful. James Cameron created a masterpiece and maybe the movie by which he will always be remembered. Flawless, enchanting, riveting, wondrous, totally out of this world. Astounding as this may sound, I\\'ve just now got around to watching \"Titanic,\" 23 years on, and I\\'m staggered at all that I\\'ve missed my whole life.\\n\\nYoung love is the most wonderful theme to explore in a movie, but it\\'s also the most difficult to depict beautifully and without too much cloying treacle. Couple that with the story of a young teenage girl in the bygone era of aristocrat families and arranged marriage, side saddles and corsets, outrageous class inequality and rich powerful men in control of everything and keeping women under their thumbs - and you get \"Titanic.\" And James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cracked it with a bang! They impressed. They dazzled. They shined.\\n\\nThey took our breath away. I finally saw Titanic when it was on network television last week. I had been avoiding it because I didn\\'t think I would like it. I hadn\\'t liked any of James Cameron\\'s other films and I didn\\'t think I would be able to make it through the entire 3 hours. The first half was like a Merchant-Ivory production and it was much better than I expected. The second half was basically a remake of the Poseidon Adventure and it was pretty much what I expected.\\n\\nMy favorite part of the film did not involve any of the lead characters. It was when the boat was about to sink and the string quartet had finished their last piece of music. They said their goodbyes and started walking away, then the violinist started playing solo. The other members came back and joined him. This part of the film showed that the musicians knew they had nowhere else to go because they were going to die. While most of the other passengers were panicking, the musicians chose to die doing what they loved most.\\n\\nThat one touching scene made the movie worthwhile for me. While I don\\'t consider it a great film and it is way too long, it is much better than I ever thought James Cameron was capable of. 7/10 nan This movie may or may not stand the test of time. Its theory of why the ship went down has since been replaced by a discussion of the fire down below. Its most indulgent moments have become the stuff of parody. But if we\\'re going to judge this film, let\\'s judge it by its impact on release. I saw it seven times before it left the theater. I was entranced by it. The performances were stunning, as was the cinematography and direction. It\\'s a great story, about the folly of human beings and the absolute imperative of living your life while you\\'ve got breath in your lungs. I loved the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet, but there were great performances as well from Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Gloria Stuart. I loved the use of music. I loved the whole thing. After you watch a film 900 times, you lose sight of what was great about it and all that remains is its imperfections. This was still a great ride. When I say that, I am not kidding anyone. Had I knew it earlier, I will have posted my review here beforehand. I had watched it once when it was at the cinemas here (and someone I know actually watched more than once!), watched twice or something when it was on the television here. The last time was like few years back on the television.\\n\\nIt goes to show how much I so love the movie, despite some may think now it\\'s cheesy to bring it up. Hey, this was a box office winner and it\\'s still at the top here in terms of ticket earnings for an opening release of a movie, from what I know. And whenever I heard Celine Dion\\'s \\'My Heart Will Go On\\', I will almost become a drama mama. Literally.\\n\\nInterstingly, I first remembered back then some years back in my school days, I was doing a comprehension passage about the cruise liner prior to the movie\\'s release and the thing at that time, I had never thought much about the comprehension passage I did after that. I had never thought that it will become a big blockbuster of the time few years later it came out. Till I (even) begged my family that I wanted to go watch it at the cinema (which it happened). I know it\\'s all fiction in the movie about the love story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCapirio) before watching it.\\n\\nThe entire movie setting is almost perfect and it will almost bring you back of the era when the actual cruise liner had its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. Even as I was watching each time, I had often wished I am boarding a luxury cruise liner (still waiting for that day). Anyone can dream.\\n\\nI have to kind of admit, interestingly, I never cried (but just felt deeply moved then) towards the end of the movie when I first saw it but subsequently when it was on the television here, tears almost started to come out of my eyes.\\n\\nAlmost a real perfect masterpiece. Just don\\'t care what others will say. nan I liked \"Titanic\". Its a good old fashioned adventure/romance/epic with a strong storyline and definable characters. Sure the tacked on romance is as stock as the characters, but that is still better than the alternative served up by most modern movies: ie--no plot and no characterization at all. The thing that bothers me about this version of the Titanic sinking is that writer/director Cameron takes full credit for the screenplay, when so much of it was directly lifted from a 1958 film about the event, \"A Night to Remember\" (also a book, and a previous film). And I\\'m not talking about the fact the Titanic sunk, or any of the other factual details of the story--obviously those will be the same. I\\'m talking about virtually identical scenes, events, and dialogue that could not be gathered from public record. Scenes such as the ship\\'s builder standing alone in the tilted ballroom, looking at the painting on the wall as the ship goes down. Or the rich ship corporation a**hole being told that yes, his ship is going to sink, no matter what he says. Or identical scenes of the steerage rabble breaking through the gates. These scenes, and many others, are mounted and shot in so similar a fashion to the previous film, with such similar dialog, that I believe they cross the border into plagerism. Rent the 1958 version of \"A Night to Remember\", watch it, and tell me I\\'m wrong. Titanic is the best 3D movie ever and also the best True Story movie ever it was just a outstanding movie that everyone will enjoy i like this movie a lot and i think you will like it to in 3D if you liked it before than you will like it even more in 3D this movie is OK for the kids it is the best Drama movie and the best movie ever created i hunk that when you see the Titanic in 3D you will say wow that was the coolest 3D movie i have ever seen that is how good this movie is i was about to cry in this movie this movie is a winner this movie is 100 percent the best movie ever oh when you go see this movie in theaters you may want to get a large popcorn because this movie is 3 hours 14 minutes long but besides that it was a wonderful movie this is a must see movie for everyone i give it two thumbs up for sure it is worth seeing you have to watch this masterpiece this is a movie that is going to be hard to get in 3D you just have to go see this movie in 3D have a great day A kid who was a loner and strived on doing things different and better, grew up to be an A-Director and in Hollywood, that is a great achievement just to be in that league, the man is James Cameron and the movie is Titanic.From the Screenplay to the the ultimate Audio dubbing at the Lucas\\'s Skywalker technology park-Cameron\\'s genius clearly shines. If there was another person who can share the credit would be James Horner. The music comes alive with the sea parting for the ocean liner. The initial departing scene in Southhamton and the the working of the engines with the sound of the pistons going fullboard \"Let us strech our legs Mr. Murdoch\" is just awesome scenes to reckon with. The sea is alive with the sound of Titanic. The scene with Rose shivering on the plank of wood is probably the weakest part of Cameron\\'s directorial brilliance. The scene is short and plastic. Gloria Stuart as the surviving \"Rose\" reminds me of Katherine Hepburn in her sincere portrayal.\\n\\nLike \"Ben-Hur\", this is a movie that will be remembered as long as the relic of Titanic remains in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. James Cameron has done a good job making one of the centuries big block busters.\\n\\nHe has used the tragic titanic accident as the background and mixed in a great love story about a poor kid and a rich women. This is really a big budget movie and it is not hard to figure out why,because they had to build everything new and some of the fx when the boat sinks are just amazing. The plot of the movie is not very deep and the 3 hours goes by like 2 hours and 50min. We must not forget that this is a BIG tragedy and that the love story is just fiction.\\n\\nIt is not one of my favourit movies, but I have to give James Camron credit for making a big budget movie like this.\\n\\nIf you are a guy between 15 and 30 I advice you to go and pick up a die hard movie instead.\\n\\nBut if you are a girl or women then this is a must.\\n\\nPs:I did actually see some boys coming crying out of the cinema. Technically this can hardly be faulted. As a spectacle...its very good. For a three hours plus movie it moves along ..OK. There are however, major problems with Titanic. (its NOT un-sinkable !!) The two leads Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movie...indeed the chemistry is never quite right between the two.(Di Caprio in particular is \"out of his depth\" here) Both actors (even apart from the relationship problem) are not at their best. Perhaps the gigantic nature of the project \"got to them\".The supporting cast play this...like they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg. The dialogue is another problem. It lacks any feeling or spontaneity, and some of the language sounds too modern. The hype surrounding this movie before release was incredible (garaunteeing a successful picture) If your happy with technology and amazing special effects...this is your movie. But don\\'t look too close....there are cracks here.... It\\'s no wonder this was so seismically successful; it really has something for everyone: a sweet tragic love story, action and suspense and for history buffs a meticulous reenactment of the most infamous sea disaster of all time. Really a stunning achievement. nan nan nan Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.\\n\\nTitanic truly is the greatest film I\\'ve ever seen. The boat had a life of its own and as does the film. What can be said about the film that hasn\\'t already been said? An absolute classic. Classic movie through and through. This movie is amazing. It allows for a great performance with the duo of two great performers.\\n\\nSad, beautiful, heartfelt.\\n\\nAnd the one thing people don\\'t appreciate is that it was told in the past tense. It was from the lens of Rose as an elderly women.\\n\\nJust an overall classic movie with excellent scenes and amazing scripting. Titanic is a movie I\\'ve seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they\\'ve seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose\\'s rich, but unpleasant fiancÃ©, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It\\'s not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn\\'t James Cameron\\'s best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn\\'t one of the best films ever, but it\\'s, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There\\'s an emotional roller-coaster going on here. Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it\\'s few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch. nan Well, it\\'s been a year since my last review of this film (this is review #3). I saw \"Titanic\" on the big screen in 1997, and bought the DVD when it came out (which I still watch from time to time, maybe about twice/year).\\n\\n\"Titanic\" still works for me as an epic spectacle and blockbuster. The love story is OK, I don\\'t really care... this is the movie to watch for eye candy and epic scope, not emotion. I never did get caught up in any sobby or sentimental emotions with this film. The overall story isn\\'t bad... yes, some of the lines are cheesy and the dialog is corny, so what? The low point of the film has to be DiCaprio sinking beneath the waves... not sad at all to me, but so what?\\n\\n\"Titanic\" stands as a fabulous spectacle and a great movie watching experience. The years have not diminished that in the least, and the special effects couldn\\'t be done any better today than they were in 1997. The nit-pickers are still picking, \\'sentimentalists\\' are still getting outraged at the \\'realists\\' bashing the film, and I\\'m still sitting back and enjoying a couple times a year a film that was highly overrated at the Oscars (so what else is new) but where every penny of the budget shows on the screen... the spectacle of it... the scope, it can sweep you away. Turn your brain off, turn the lights down, and enjoy on the biggest possible screen.\\n\\n9/10 pieces of popcorn from this 38 year old male. Well here it is, three years after the release of Titanic, and the movie is still eminently watchable. I have the DVD version, and watch it occasionally. I\\'ve come to realize that the love story (which MANY have complained about) serves to offset the \"disaster\" portion of the movie *perfectly*. Without it, watching \"Titanic\" would simply be a bleak and depressing experience. But notice how the love story reaches its peak JUST as the ship crashes into the iceberg, and a crossover effect is achieved -- disaster intersects with love and the human spirit. Without the love story (and no, I didn\\'t think it was particularly cheesy), Titanic would not be the movie that it is.\\n\\nPeople have said that this movie has \"aged\" poorly since its original release. I don\\'t think so. I saw it three times on the big screen when it came out, and bought the DVD when *it* first came out. Multiple viewings have not diminished this movie for me. It still stands as the finest movie of 1997, and the best epic disaster film ever made. Remember, this movie is not a documentary, and was never intended to be. Some people don\\'t quite seem to get that point. As for Leonardo Dicaprio, I do feel they could have chosen a different actor for the part and it would have improved things, but only a little. This film has only one lead character, the Titanic Herself. All the rest are extras, albeit important ones.\\n\\nIf you\\'re one of those rare birds who hasn\\'t seen \"Titanic\" yet, don\\'t listen to its detractors. Watch the movie and judge it for yourself. I won\\'t comment on the special effects, except to say they\\'re incredible and 99% seamless. The story (taken as a whole) is profound and moving. No other disaster film (the innumerable \"Airport 19xx\\'s\" and others) have managed to capture the human side of a major 20th century disaster so effectively. And this is still a great \\'date movie\\' as well. It succeeds from many, many angles -- so many that its flaws (yes, it has some) can and should be overlooked. Director James Cameron put his heart and soul into this film, and it shows.\\n\\nVerdict: Acquitted on ALL charges and rated 9/10 for true excellence in filmmaking. Many have commented recently that \"Titanic\" was overrated/overhyped, some even saying it was \"the most overhyped movie in history\" (somehow I doubt that... perhaps Waterworld might take that prize, or maybe Independence Day or Jurassic Park).\\n\\nAnyway, what makes no sense to me is this... why haven\\'t you shaken off the hype yet? The movie isn\\'t playing in theaters anymore, it isn\\'t being hyped up anywhere. So can\\'t you just put in in your DVD player/VCR/whatever and watch it for what it is? I mean, that\\'s all it ever was anyway, \\'hype\\' is just \\'consensus conditioning\\' and you don\\'t have to be affected by it at all unless you choose to.\\n\\nThat said, I maintain my stance that \\'Titanic\\' is still a great, entertaining film, that it was never meant to be a documentary (and would have suffered greatly without the tension-relieving love-story subplot), and my agreement that DiCaprio was a poor choice for the male lead.\\n\\nAnyway... I can put the DVD in every once in awhile, sit back and watch this movie for what it shows me... the \\'hype\\' was forgotten over three years ago. And I like the film. If you don\\'t like the film, fine, but quit complaining about it being overhyped and/or overrated. Do you still remember the weather the day the film was released, too? Just as the ship that couldn\\'t be sunk sank in 1910, the movie \"Titanic\" which should not have failed went belly up and fell to the bottom of the sea. I seem to be going against the grain here and maybe I was the only one seeing this movie who didn\\'t get it. I readily that there are great moments in this movie. The dramatic sequence where the Titantic ship becomes flooded with water and eventually sinks to the bottom is brilliant. What director James Cameron also does very well in exposing the sheer unfairness that some were allowed on the life boats, while others were not. In that connection, there was a emotive scene with a navy officer who, often against his own will, enforced this unfair system to the letter, not because it was the right thing to do, but because there were only so many life boats to go around and the prevailing view was that the few life boats available should go to the rich -- with the result that the rest were, in effect, left to die. What is also very good is that scene where some of the passengers are floating in the ice cold water, clinging on to whatever they could get their hands on, and quickly freezing to death.\\n\\nYet, the film still does not quite work because of what preceded this sad, dramatic tragedy that was the sinking of the titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s Jack and Kate Winslet\\'s Rose were plausible characters, but they were very annoying to watch. Some of their lines were so out of place and absurd that I felt deeply embarrassed watching these people. The love story seemed rather contrived and unbelievable. Finally, James Horner\\'s music in the background just made the whole thing worse. In short, I did not feel anything for these characters or identify with their love story; and that, more than anything else, was what dragged this movie down. nan Titanic (1997)\\n\\n11 Academy Awards - Including Picture, Director and Score\\n\\nThe Number 1 Grossing Film Of All Time - $1,845,000,000.\\n\\nTitanic is a glorious achievement; this isn\\'t a film. It\\'s much more than a film; it\\'s an experience. You yourself feel you are on that ship; your emotions, your mood corresponds that of the characters.\\n\\nJames Cameron\\'s direction is a technical triumph. The man did not only manage to put to use a $202,000,000 budget, capture never before built sets, but on top of all that he had to show us characters, feelings, stories, lives and the ultimate fate of a doomed liner. Cameron passes the test that really takes every cinematic element to the maximum.\\n\\nForget all that now. When you walk into a cinema and sit down for 3 hours which only seem like 90 minutes, you will know why Titanic is the film it is. A masterpiece in every respect. Maybe not the greatest film ever made, but a nearly perfect cinematic achievement, in terms of storyline, focus and technical superiority.\\n\\n\"Grandeur and Love collide with an inevitable destiny in James Cameron\\'s stunning masterpiece. Titanic. Best Film of 1997 and one of the most perfect films of recent years\" Titanic is iconic film from different points of view. Firstly, the plot is interesting, it shows passengers\\' fates before the catastrophe. It shows that love doesn\\'t understand social differences. It shows that richness is not enough for full life. Secondly, the cast is great, Leonardo DiCaprio does his work perfectly, Kate Winslet is the brilliant of film. Thirdly, action itself is awesome, it looks like Cameron destroyed the ship really. So, it\\'s amazing film for all times. The film masters in fictionalising a firm love tale and gently pressing it in between a beautifully intense reenactment of the Titanic\\'s disastrous tragedy. Although it\\'s not what you\\'d class as a romantic thriller, it\\'s incredibly romantic and very thrilling; audiences will specifically admire just the romance, the thrills, or both! And within a runtime of 3 hours, James Cameron portrays the fluently-designed story in a way that never gets boring, constantly moves swiftly, and remains a true classic.\\n\\nThe first half of the movie portrays a fictional but a very solid and tragic love story. Most romance movies that end in tragedy are ones where one of the lead lovers die. Whether Titanic involves that or not, it\\'s never as sappy or average as other films that do that. The depiction of the relationship between memorable characters, Jack and Rose, is acceptable. But their story would never be as great if it weren\\'t all taken and set on ship that leads to sinking.\\n\\nWhat\\'s most memorable about the film, and what makes it such a classic epic, is the second half of the film. Titanic focuses on romance, but steers the ship to hit the iceberg and begin sinking. It\\'s thankfully not just a 10 minute sequence, but devotes the entire sinking of the ship to the second half of the movie. The portrayal of the Titanic beginning to forward to the bottom of the ocean, snapping into two, and sticking right up before heading straight down is astonishingly-crafted. It\\'s all gorgeous, intense, epic and depressing.\\n\\nAlthough the storytelling comes from Rose, the actual tale is equally viewed through the eyes of both Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s young Jack and Kate Winslet\\'s young Rose. Thankfully, it\\'s not targeted at only one\\'s issues. Celine Dion\\'s \"My Heart Will Go on\" makes the perfect theme, the cast\\'s performances make the perfect characters, and the whole movie should be left as the classic storyteller of Titanic.\\n\\nIf you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews. nan nan nan All these years I\\'ve never wanted to sit down and watch this movie for various reasons. Yesterday, I just decided to randomly sit down and watch this movie, expecting nothing but a cheesy over the top romance movie. I was pleasantly surprised and blown away.\\n\\nAs a person whose only ever seen Cameron\\'s big three: T2, Aliens and Terminator, I never thought that any movie could ever near those three films. I have yet to see \\'Avatar\\' which I will sometime but back to topic- Titanic blew me away as I had such low expectations.\\n\\nEveryone knows the story of \\'Titanic\\', where a young boy and girl meet and fall in love. As time goes by, Titanic crashes into an iceberg causing the ship to slowly start to sink as the romance between the two gets stronger. Everyone also knows that this movie is somewhat considered one of the best and has won 11 Oscars, the most that is only tied with \\'Return of the King\\' and \\'Ben-hur\\'.\\n\\nThere is so much that I love about \\'Titanic\\' that I don\\'t like in most romance movies. The chemistry between the two is amazing. The acting is great, the story is beautiful and emotionally gripping, the visuals are amazing, the epic scope is breath taking and the last hour is breath taking intensity after intensity. The characters are also amazing and the music is just beautiful. Cameron\\'s writing and directing is great despite some cheesy lines such as \\'I\\'m flying!\\' My main concern with Titanic before watching it was that I believed that Cameron wouldn\\'t be up to the challenge as he is a director of action movies: T2, Aliens, Terminator, The Abyss, True Lies etc. He proved me wrong and I only love Cameron more for this! He has mastered creating epic dramas and epic romances with this movie To conclude this review here, \\'Titanic\\' is an awesome, beautiful and emotionally gripping romance tale that is masterfully directed, brilliantly acted, with amazing visuals, a huge scope, amazing music and some great characters. The movie itself doesn\\'t deserve to be called one of the very best nor in my opinion does it deserve the 11 Oscars it got but \\'Titanic\\' is still....An amazing movie that everyone needs to check out! nan Titanic is one of the most successful films in recent history. It won a lot of Oscars and really is one of the better films that is based off a historical event.\\n\\nThe effects are phenomenal in this film. The Titanic looks as how it should have and looks real. They really got the details down perfectly and it seemed as if each room shown in the film was flawless.\\n\\nSome of the scenes in this film are just awesome. Especially the scene where the Titanic hits the Iceberg. THe whole sinking scene in particular is dramatic and will keep you captivated.\\n\\nActing is good for the most part. DiCaprio is pretty good in this film and this may be one of his better performances but I really have not seen that many of his films. Same with Kate Winslett. Actually acting may be the biggest weakness of the film but that is just because everything else is outstanding. I thought the captain of the Titanic was well performed as were the entire crew of the Titanic.\\n\\nMusic is spectacular. Not much more to add.\\n\\nThis is a really good film. Not a ten out of ten for me but a solid nine out of ten and a film that I highly recommend to the likely two people out there that have never seen it. An appalling, galling \\'spectacle\\' and slapdash mix of effects, melodrama and romance. \"Titanic\" is utterly misguided; shamefully populist and hoist by its own focus group petard. This is not showmanship of the grandiose and warm kind of a Selznick; it is the cold, mechanical assemblage feat of a bragging Cameron. It is far from unique; and much in the usual Hollywood action vein, with undramatic noisiness, prosaic lighting, and faceless acting.\\n\\nEven \\'Our Kate\\' can\\'t save it... the busty Miss Winslet puts a bit more presence into things initially, but she can\\'t truly work within the confines of such a dire nonentity of a script; her Rose just becomes irritating and strained in effect as the film wears painfully on. Di Caprio is awful; a rubbery, glib little presence who increases the quotient of dull artifice - that this film is already unduly well stocked with. Indeed, this film may as well not have included any actors, as Cameron seems so entirely disinterested in them; for all the pretence of this being a \\'human story\\', there is precious little humanity in this film. An out-of-place love story \\'suffices\\'; actors like Bernard Hill are left adrift, with little to convey - even in a film stretching past three hours. A problem is that the effects are flashy and thoroughly incongruous to any image of the historical event. Crucially there is no dignity to this film; where it should have used Gavin Bryars\\' poignant, cavernous, driftwood-epic soundscape, \"The Sinking of the Titanic\" for its score, instead we have James Horner\\'s parodic, cliched John Williams-esque bluster and blandness, telegraphing every \\'emotion\\' and example of pyrotechnics. It\\'s an awful score, instilling a very familiar, action movie-moronic ethos; this sense of the events being sold short comes across equally in Di Caprio\\'s pipsqueak playing and Winslet\\'s rather ungainly starry turn.\\n\\nHow much better would the historical events have been served by Bryars\\' music, dignified, still and unusual camera placements, and a depersonalized sad grandeur? A semi-documentary, in grainy, mournful black and white would far better suit this subject; think \"Wisconsin Death Trip\" and you\\'ll be understand in part how I envisage it. I want to shut this awful James Cameron white elephant out of my mind, and let a more graceful film play there.\\n\\nRating:- */***** Yes, he was right. There is one s____r born every minute. This movie proves that enough of those were born to carry this waste of celluloid to $1.6 billion dollars in gross earnings.\\n\\n\"Waste of celluloid\"? No, wait. That\\'s a gross exaggeration. Actually, you could snip out all the scenes with Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet, shorten the sinking scenes by 1/2, add some historical characters, and end up with a glorious 1 1/2 - 2 hour movie. Because, as it is, this movie is a gross slap on the face of all those who lost their lives on that ship, who seemingly died so that Kate Winslet could \"live her life to the fullest extent\".\\n\\nThe movie, well, it\\'s unwatchable. Completely, totally unwatchable as it is. That is, if you are not a 15 year old girl with a crush on diCaprio. For the rest of us, the movie drags incredibly slowly. Honestly, I only wanted for the thing to start sinking after the first hour.\\n\\nOTOH, the sinking scenes are terrific. Way above average. Very, very good. But what\\'s the use of those scenes when you have to endure the pain of 1 1/2 hours of romantic nonsense? Especially when there is absolutely NO chemistry between the main characters.\\n\\nI have another idea. Steal some scenes from \"A Night to Remember\", cut the sinking scenes from \"Titanic\", and make a new movie. That would be good.... but no hordes of screaming girls would attend the movie, so no box office records could be made, so no Hollywood director would attempt to do it.\\n\\nThat is the real tragedy. Breathtaking it was not. Amazing? I don\\'t think so. Brilliant? Yeah right! The best movie ever made? Not even close. Yet, the Box Office would make out that this pathetic attempt to reinact a tragic undertaking (which has been reinacted more times than I care to count) was actually pretty good. Very good, even. Hell - because of the soppy do-gooders of the world that went to see this, it\\'s the Highest Grossing movie of all time, and we\\'re told that it\\'s a \\'wonderful tale, with wonderful actors, a wonderful script and wonderful sets\\'.\\n\\nPULEEEEEESE! There is absolutely no talent in Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet or Billy Zane, the sets were completely overdone, and unrealistically fake, the script was complete Loserville-ish and boring.\\n\\nThe only part that was good was when Rose was going to fall off the ship, and when that guy gets hit by the ship propeller at the end. This undeserved multiple Oscar Award winning film rates 1Â½/10 - James Cameron should not have wasted his time and money!! \"Titanic\"....this movie on the surface would normally strike fear into the hearts of film fans like myself, who usually despise most typical mainstream drivel. While I am a huge film fan, I rarely go to the movies in theaters anymore because everything just looks so BAD. The last film I have seen in theaters was actually \"Spider-Man,\" a great film marred by the horrible cartoonish special effects.\\n\\nMy tastes in film vary greatly...I love the classics (Cagney, Bogie, etc), romance, B-flicks, Godzilla films, car chases, superhero stuff and much more. However, almost all the films I like were made before the 90\\'s, when film started to get REALLY bad. I also love to observe a good phenomenon - whoch \"Titanic\" became almost instantly.\\n\\nI read all about \"Titanic\" before it was released, how the budget went up to a staggering $200 million making the film a tremendous gamble. When it was released in late \\'97, it did very good but not great numbers - but the word of mouth on this film was unlike anything seen since Star Wars probably - the box office take remained steady for a LONG time. As weeks went by, it actually earned more and more, and the phenomenon had started.\\n\\nThen in late 1998, when the film was still playing some theaters almost a year later, and for a whole year we\\'ve heard how unbelievable \"Titanic\" was and how Leo was adored by girls all over the world and how hot Kate was - I finally kicked in 2 bucks at a discount theater to see what all the fuss was finally about. Alone (in a packed theater) as not to be distracted by a friend, I got my snick snacks, found my seat, and watched with a completely open mind.\\n\\nThree hours later, I, who again hates virtually everything mainstream these days, said to myself, that was one of the greatest films I had ever seen.\\n\\nMany say \"Titanic\" is \"fomulatic,\" \"typical Hollywood drivel,\" and the famous, \"...but we know the ending, the ship sinks.\" I say, \"Titanic\" was an extremely rare present-day excursion in old-school grandiose film-making. Huge sets were built as opposed to having everything drawn with computer effects. It was a great romantic story, which the audience was compelled to feel for, especially having the knowledge ahead of time that it would be doomed (\"the ship sinks\"). It had great drama, great music (even the one song I can stand hearing Celine Dion sing), and a lot of heart from James Cameron who, love him or hate him, showed amazing dedication to getting his epic on screen.\\n\\nAnd say whatever you want about Leonardo DiCaprio - he was excellent in Titanic and is one of the very best actors out there right now.\\n\\nAnyone who has read some of my other reviews would know that I hate computer effects. But the CGI in \"Titanic\" is the one instance where they actually do work a little, because they do not overtake the picture and aren\\'t the focus. It definitely is not the same as watching a cartoon Spider-Man battle a cartoon Green Goblin in a film that is not supposed to be a cartoon.\\n\\n\"Titanic,\" dare I say, is the \"Gone With The Wind\" of our time. it\\'s a huge movie, a blood, sweat and tears movie, a movie with some real elbow grease behind it. And never boring for a second.\\n\\n\"Titanic\" is arguably the best film of the 90\\'s (only \"Goodfellas\" gives it a run for that title in my opinion), and is probably one of the greatest 40 films ever made. Now that may be a surprising thing for me to say given I am such a huge fan of the classics, but however rare it may be, there are extremely rare instances when something new is in the same league as something classic.\\n\\nOne last note - it is surprising that this film has such a bare-bones DVD out. While there are rumors that a \"special edition\" DVD is in the works, the present DVD is a disappointment with no extras at all. Considering this movie at three hours long had two hours CUT from it alone would make some good extras in deleted scenes. Add on the commentaries, a few \"makings of\" and add on a bunch of other crap and you have got a killer, proper DVD release for \"Titanic.\" If you have not seen Titanic, I\\'m sure you\\'ve heard of it, and of so, please do watch it because not only is the film a \"great watch\" or a great \"thrill ride of suspense and emotional scenes\", but Titanic is one of the greatest films of all time. The film has some of the best acting from Winslet and DiCaprio and some of the best character chemistry between them. The direction lead by James Cameron is phenomenal. The ending to the film is one of the most intense, beautiful and sad endings I\\'ve ever seen, i can not remark one flaw about it. The cinematography is great and the film has some of the best and most memorable shots in cinema history (yes, that including the scene where Jack holds Rose up at the ship deck). The soundtrack is amazing, including Celine Dion\\'s fantastic song that totally fits the feel of the film. Titanic is a must watch, one i would have killed for to see on the big screen!\\n\\nI will be posting a review of AHS Apocalypse Episode 3 this evening after the confirmed return of Cordelia, Madison and Myrtle, so exciting!! Stay tuned This movie was way too long! I have seen Leonardo DiCaprio do better acting when he was a kid on \"Growing Pains.\" There were so many unbelievable plots in this movie. Why would people bring guns on a ship and shoot people. There are so many unanswered questions in this movie. Why were the rich people so mean and snobby? This movie won eleven Oscars? 1997 must have been a very bad year for movies. Who did the extensive research for this movie? How do they know what happened on the Titanic? Very few people (if any) that were on that ship are alive today. Most of the actors did a very good job. However, I haven\\'t seen many of them in other movies. The ship did look luxurious for 1912. In the whistle - OU.T of the Boom - I.OU in the BOAT\\n\\nAnimals get whistled for. BOAT being GOAT. I.OU, of course, is a \"slant\" on the I of insider and the OU of OU.T - T stands for T intelligence Why \"As Good As It Gets\" did not win for best picture over Titanic is beyond me. Titanic is, at best, an average movie but some pretty impressive special effects. The story, however, is not believable and nor are the characters. I found it too long and lacking character development. I would advise everyone to see it but don\\'t expect it to be up to its Best Picture Award. For weeks after seeing the film, whenever I heard on the radio the flute introduction to \"My Heart Will Go On\" (Celine Dion), I became teary-eyed! So, I guess I am a sentimentalist! I think James Cameron delivered a unique, technically-brilliant period piece that could touch the heart, and inform audiences about some significant features of a long-forgotten era.\\n\\nFor one, this time period was marked by severe class distinction. I believe that, in 1900, 1% of the USA population controlled 99% of the wealth. Britain, of course, had always been a society where the privileged were noted by everything from their manner of dress, hat style, speech patterns, and clubs where they drank. The film shows the severe gap between the wealthy first-class passengers, and those in \\'steerage\\' where Jack was lodged. Some have argued that poor Jack would never have gotten near Rose a second time. But remember: Rose is a rebel. There\\'s the basis for the relationship. And what better way to illustrate the snobbery of class distinction than by having Jack sit down to dinner with the crusty industrialists? Also, many on the Titanic were on their way to the \\'new world\\' for great opportunities. They had a great struggle (note the passengers who could neither read nor write English?), but they came anyway to escape the oppression of cruel power struggles in Europe.\\n\\nThe sheer folly - and tragedy - of piling through iceberg-infested waters in a large, awkward vessel is explained and demonstrated very clearly (in case anyone is still trying to figure it out!).\\n\\nThis film is on my IMDb Top-20 .. http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=8401903 (yikes-I realized I better get busy and finally write a review!), but I will admit that some shortfalls in screenplay prevent it from usurping \\'Citizen Kane\\', \\'Amadeus\\' or Sir David Lean\\'s entries as a true cinematic masterpiece. Note that I said screenplay - not acting, for actors can only deliver the lines on the page. I have always loved PART-1 much more than PART-2. I think that has to do with the \\'mix\\' and \\'editing\\', particularly involving the final scene with Jack and Rose. A few snips here and there would have reduced the melodramatic element. Overall, a little less of the love story, and more development of some other characters would have elevated the presentation. My take is that the screenplay \\'missed\\' - but not by much. The result was a brilliant piece of cinematography that could not field any major players as viable candidates for Oscars in acting.\\n\\nHaving said that, there is so much to recommend this fine film. I was very moved by the way Cameron had his Titanic cast assemble for a sort of curtain-call within the movie - haven\\'t seen that before, very unique and effective.\\n\\n9/10 - canuckteach (--: Hands down one of the best romance films ever made, Titanic is an epic, action-packed historical love story that delivers in every single way. Brilliant performance by Kate Winslet, beautiful and accurate costumes, feminist undertones, heart-wrenching, and golden to its core! Titanic is one of the greatest films ever made and that\\'s all that has to be said. nan Why Titanic isn\\'t on the Top 250, I just don\\'t know. It is, by far, the most successful film of all time, and deservedly so. Nobody could have captured with such emotion and scope the depiction of what happened in the Atlantic 95 years ago except James Cameron. Terminator 3 and this had the same budget - Terminator 3 was good, but this film blew me away. It truly raises the bar for film-making and success in the film industry. It has been a couple of years since I last saw this film, and my memory starts to fail me. But you just can\\'t forget some of the special effects on this film and how they changed the world of films. Monumental images that stick in your mind forever are created with grand scale to breathtaking effect, and the film stays emotional throughout its three hours - so you always care. This film was made to win Oscars, and win Oscars it did. Though Lord of the Rings: Return of the King managed to win all of its nominations (Titanic did have 14 nominations and won 11), box office grosses and general audience feelings will always precede Titanic as the better film. Truly a Titanic achievement... 10/10 that is, by you IMDb voters. You seem to be the only people in the world to think this movie isn\\'t great. This film is a masterpiece, which belongs in your top 250. It\\'s the only 3 hour movie that doesn\\'t bore me. In fact, no one in the cinema seemed bored when i saw it. If you think that this movie is silly because of the dialogue, it\\'s obvious you\\'re all forgetting that this movie was made to entertain! It\\'s the same thing with star wars: it\\'s sort of a fable, and the dialogue is much cheesier than that of this film. It has great music, great special effects, great sound and fantastic cinematography. It was definitely the best picture of 1997, and Kate should have won the best actress award. I avoided watching this movie for years and years, despite the entreaties of friends who insisted I would love it. Finally, many years after this was released, I capitulated and watched it with a friend. It was as bad as I had suspected. Overrated, predictable, overly sentimental and dull. I can\\'t work out why so many people love it. It\\'s a Hallmark movie on steroids. nan Let\\'s start with James Cameron. He made the greatest action movie ever made and also one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, The Terminator 2 Judgment Day. The Terminator was excellent too, but 2 surpassed even that. By only these two movies, he has become one of the greatest directors of all time, don\\'t you agree? However, it was really weird that he wanted to make such a movie. Thus, Titanic does not look like a James Cameron movie at all and additionally it is lack of creativity, James Cameron creativity. You know, by considering The Terminator movies, you can see how a creative director James Cameron is. Titanic is an ordinary movie, a simple movie on all counts. Everything is simple that I will mention later. At that time, Leonardo Di Caprio was at the top, the beloved of teenage girls, in fact, young or not, females were admirers of him. I like Di Caprio and he is still liked, may be even more because of the performances he gave in his recent movies, but what I am trying to say is that I try to find out the reasons, why a lot of people love the movie and it broke a record at the box office, became the most watched film of all time? It was owing to Di Caprio? Well, I don\\'t think so, I mean not only owing to him which is sad. Because as said the movie is simple on all counts. As for Kate Winslett, as an actress, she is one of my favorite actresses ever, I just love her, but players cannot save a movie, this is what I believe. The love story is simple. Let me summarize it one more time. A poor boy. A rich girl. And the rich (and black hearted) fiancÃ©e of that girl. The family of the girl want their daughter marry him, but she is not sure. Then, the poor boy and the girl meet and fall in love with each other. See? You know, James Cameron is rather an action (and science fiction) director, isn\\'t he? and this is a disaster movie besides romance, isn\\'t it? but this side of the matter, action, excitement are simple either. You expect the same masterful, perfectionist and creative level for Titanic, but it is not. I did not get satisfy on this count, because Cameron does not focus on disaster, he focuses on romance and this is weird. This is a three hours movie, but the disaster side of it is unsatisfying. Therefore, the people who had expected an exciting, suspenseful disaster movie disappoint like me. As for the Oscar issue, yes it broke a record in the Oscar history too, 11 Oscars! To me, there are two wrong decisions in the Oscar history. One is Titanic\\'s 11 Oscar winning, the other is Shakespeare in Love won the best picture Oscar instead of Saving Private Ryan. I should confess that the other was much more painful, because if you ask me, to give the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare in Love while one of the other nominees is Saving Private Ryan is something like to give the best picture Oscar to The Notebook while one of the other nominees is 12 Angry Men. Returning to Titanic, the love story in it is not heavy or dull at all like Shakespeare in Love by the way which is good news and despite I am not female, it was real touching and at the end, my ears filled with tears. However, unfortunately these do not make the movie great. Let\\'s talk about the branches which Titanic won Oscar. By the way, as for entertainment, yes I was entertained, but not very much. The best editing. Well, this is not Memento or Amores Perros, the editing was \\'normal\\' in this one. The best cinematography. If it is one of the bests, then what is Amelie then for example or Across the Universe? The best costume design. What were the costumes, daily life costumes? Yes. Titanic was not a period movie exactly wasn\\'t it? Even if it was, the costumes were ordinary, daily life costumes. The best art direction. Again, Titanic is \\'normal\\' on this count. Amelie, 2001, Batman, these are the examples come to my mind now. If we talk about the themes of the movie, it is seen that they are simple either as everything else. Follow your heart, money does not bring happiness, believe immortal love etc. I\\'m rewatching this now. It has held up very well after all these years. I saw this in the theaters when I was 22. It was just me and my boyfriend who I recently just started seeing. We are no longer together, but I still remember him saying that the way the two were holding each others hands at the bow of the boat, reminded him of the way we touched each other\\'s hands at the time. We were in love, just as Rose and Jack were. This movie also touched home because I too came from money and thought most of the rich people I knew and had dated were uptight and didn\\'t seem to let loose enough and have fun....and I was afraid too I would fall in a trap to it and live a boring existence. It gave me more strength to branch out and not search for someone to love just because of their wealth and status in the world, but instead find love for whats inside a person. My world is better now because of that decision. So I thank you Titanic! This is a bad film. When I say \"bad\", I mean it in a whole range of senses. Just a few of them: The fictitious love story is anachronistic, exploitative and implausible (he gets a monkey suit and gatecrashes the First Class?). The way a modern-movie-style sex scene is fitted into the film just stinks.\\n\\nEven the special effects -- so highly praised -- are suspect in my book. The ship gliding through the water does not look real. It is somehow \"flat\".\\n\\nThe scene where Jack dies in the water is nearly as laughable as the unforgettable death scene in \"Love Story\".\\n\\nEven calling the ship \"Titanic\" instead of \"The Titanic\" is wrong.\\n\\nIt just goes to show what hype, hype and yet more hype can achieve. There is, in the Motion Picture Academy, a hidden criterion for awards. It\\'s called the Miracle Factor. If a huge, overblown spectacle film production manages to make a killing at the box office and isn\\'t as bad a everyone thought it would be, it acknowledges this miracle with its Best Picture award. This has happened at least twice: in 1952, the malign, Red-baiting Cecil B. De Mille, bullied the corrupt, Red-baiting Academy into presenting him with an Oscar for the ridiculous circus spectacle, Greatest Show on Earth; then, in 1997, an equally corrupt, politically correct Academy presented Titanic with its Oscar.\\n\\nTitanic deserved an Oscar in only one category - special effects. The story was trite, the acting mediocre (except Leo\\'s, which didn\\'t even get nominated), the editing OK (maybe deserving of an Oscar, since great special effects demand great editing).\\n\\nTitanic\\'s \"beating\" out L.A. Confidential is akin to Greatest Show on Earth\\'s \"beating\" out High Noon. Standing alone, Titanic is just another disaster spectacle. But placed beside a film like L.A. Confidential, Titanic becomes pure garbage.\\n\\nThis view is no better vindicated than by the Academy\\'s choice for Best Picture the following year, Shakespeare in Love. If Titanic got the \"Miracle it Wasn\\'t That Bad\" Oscar, then Shakespeare in Love was given the \"Bad Conscience for Titanic\" Oscar.\\n\\nBy the way, if you want to see a GOOD dramatization of the Titanic disaster, get A Night to Remember instead of this travesty. An exciting story about the sinking of the \"unsinkable\" Titannic on February 4, 1912 with the loss of over 3,000 passengers. The story is viewed by 95 year old rescued woman played by Gloria Stuart. Her viewpoint of her love affair with Jack Dawson who gave her strength to carry on. Jack Dawson is played by Leonardo de Caprio and his lover played by Kate Winslet. She tells of an exciting escape from the vessel on that dark cold night. The film lasts 139 minutes with an intermission.. Fine acting, music, and some very intense moments. John Cameron is the director, and he and the film won several Academy Awards for 1997. This is one of Leonardo de Caprio\\'s best movies. 7/10 In general I am not keen on large budget spectacular productions such as \"Titanic\". Whilst the large budget goes in creating expensive but not always useful (and even sometimes counterproductive) special effects, it also creates a situation where enormous public interest becomes necessary if the investors are to recover their money; so that the film concerned has to be continually promoted with a great deal of hype. Seldom does the excessive expenditure lead to a better script, better acting, better direction or better photography, and these are what govern the quality of the final product. Titanic won an incredible number of Oscars, which are supposed to be completely independent awards (11 in all I believe). At the time I cynically took the view that the need for these Oscars as a bait for attracting large audiences had led to extensive funding of media promotions designed to ensure that this particular film was in the mind of all the judges when the selections were actually being made. I also remember feeling very upset that several superb performances in lesser low budget films made during the same year appeared to be being squeezed out by all this hoop-la. Nevertheless once all these awards had been made, I had sufficient faith in the Academy Award system to assume that there must indeed be something totally exceptional about this movie, and I made a mental note that I should see it at some future time.\\n\\nIt was a long time after this, when I did so, and found to my amazement the film was only a somewhat indifferent fictional drama in the tearjerker category, with its appeal stiffened by some very spectacular special effects. It was also far far too lengthy to sustain the viewer\\'s interest in its rather simple dramatic story. My faith in the Academy Award system was bruised but not totally broken as I told myself that I must be missing something if I could not fully endorse the apparent judgement of the vast mass of the public and almost all the critics. This feeling continued until only a few days ago when I chanced to browse through the user comments on this film in your data base and at last realized that my views were quite widely supported and I need not be ashamed of them. (The fact that I initially felt ashamed of my rather critical views is probably a good indication of the degree of hype which developed around this film.)\\n\\nI am not attempting to deny that Titanic is certainly a better than average film and I do not want my comments to appear totally destructive. The recreation of the ship, and of its death throes, is superbly done but if one is viewing the most expensive movie ever filmed one is entitled to expect very dramatic special effects - the real question is what do they really contribute to the story, and in this case the answer is very little. Overall, the film is extremely well made, but its script is very poor, the characterisation is stereotyped and much of the acting is no more than acceptable, I can see nothing other than some effective but unimportant special effects to justify the status it has been accorded. It fails right from the start as it does not appear to know whether it is intended as a documentary record of a dreadful tragedy or a bittersweet but highly improbable romance. The disparate pull of these two themes continues throughout the film, but ultimately leaves the documentary recreation of the liner and its one tragic voyage as certainly its best feature.\\n\\nWhy did the scriptwriter and director (James Cameron) feel that it was necessary to incorporate a fictional romance into this film? Over fifteen hundred real people actually died, wives and children were torn from fathers they hardly knew. There was real drama in why the Carpathia did not steam to the rescue of the survivors more promptly and this has remained of ongoing interest ever since. The design of the ship, the materials used in its construction, the route followed by the voyage, and the part played by the so-called blue riband for the fastest Atlantic crossing have all been featured in dramas relating to this voyage and some of them were also mentioned in passing in this film. Surely there was enough dramatic interest in the actual story to avoid any need for the fictional additions. In practice this decision has detracted so much from the tale which was crying out to be told that for me at least the film was spoiled.\\n\\nThe rating you give it will depend primarily upon whether you regard the fictional romance or the factual documentary of the Titanic\\'s only voyage as of greater importance. My rating for the romance between Rose and Jack would be no higher than 3/10 because most of the characters concerned are no more than caricatures. The documentary leaves out so much that a similar rating could seem quite generous, but the special effects recreation of the actual sinking makes me feel that a rating of 5/10 would actually be reasonable. Averaging these, and ignoring the problems associated with not knowing whether the film is a romance or a documentary, yields a final rating for the film as released of 4/10, which is probably reasonable. From James Cameron , the director of Aliens. Thats all i needed to hear to know i was going to see Titanic. Without a doubt one of the best love stories i have seen in a long time. All of this was very attractive. Great director, great cast, a Romeo and Juliet style love story and a hand full of positive reviews. Even though it was good i still don\\'t see why it made over a billion dollars. I saw it and couldn\\'t see what the deal was all those years ago.\\n\\nLeo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet lead the fine cast. Both had chemistry and gave us a romantic love story. Both give great performances and were great choices.\\n\\nI recommend it but don\\'t expect much. It was good but not that good. Had a great cast and great love story but that is all thats here. If your looking for a good love story watch this or the notebook.\\n\\n6/10 The love stories that take place on cruise ships/ocean liners are things like Letty Lynton (1932), Love Affair (1939 one) and Now, Voyager (1942). All three of those are fairly melodramatic, have a touch of tragedy, but they all end up well in the end. And they\\'re well done- good cinematography, good acting, the leads have chemistry, and I want Joan Crawford\\'s Letty Lynton dress in my wardrobe. What does this film have to offer?\\n\\nA cure for insomnia and major disappointment. Not that I was expecting anything going in.\\n\\nI think I set a record for complaining- I moaned all the way through this film when my mother forced me to watch it. She loves it, but I think she just loves it because of the sheep mentality that newer films force on us. This film (if one can call it a film) has a twenty minute plot padded out into three hours and fourteen minutes. Neither Winslet nor DiCaprio can act to save their lives, they don\\'t have any chemistry...and...guess what...Kate Winslet bares her breasts again! Did she ever do anything else? These people are Oscar-winning actors? Don\\'t make me laugh. The rest of the supporting cast may as well be made of cardboard. Kathy Bates was just annoying. All the characters were clichÃ©s to begin with, not even actors that could act could have pulled this film off.\\n\\nThe director is not a good director. He uses generic, already used shots from other films. Kate Winslet\\'s \"contemplating suicide\" scene is borrowed from Mildred Pierce (which, funnily, Kate would go on to star in a craptastic remake of.) I was actually cheering when the boat started sinking.\\n\\nBut then it got boring, because that five minute plot device was the second half of the film.\\n\\nI also cheered when Leonardo DiCaprio died, because I don\\'t like him, he\\'s not attractive (he doesn\\'t even have charisma) and he\\'s got a stupid haircut that no-one had in 1912, or even 1952. Another cheer came out of me when the credits rolled, although that cheer became a gag when I realized that they were going to play that godawful theme song. The Celine Dion croaks. You know, \"My Heart Will Go On.\"\\n\\nHow this film was nominated for fourteen Oscars is beyond me. Although, I hope people note that none of them were for acting. All About Eve, which held the record for most Oscar nods before this film slogged its way into the Oscars, is not a great film, and not worthy of 14 Oscar nods, but it\\'s still eons better than this trash masquerading as a \"modern day classic\".\\n\\nThis is one of those films that more people talk about than have actually seen. Just don\\'t see it. Waste your time watching another movie instead. Like Casablanca, which is the SECOND most overrated love story of all time.\\n\\nThis one is first.\\n\\nBy the way, I love melodrama, and I am a teenage girl. It\\'s really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it\\'s also a tremendous achievement for it\\'s director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say \"I\\'m king of the world\" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.\\n\\nThe modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Cameron\\'s real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate\\'s Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.\\n\\nHowever,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,it\\'s schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.\\n\\nTitanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horner\\'s best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose\\'s fiancÃ©e,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}\\n\\nOverall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this. The story of a pair of star-crossed lovers captured the hearts of millions of people, even mine (and I\\'m not a fan of the romance genre).\\n\\nThis film is not just about them, though. It\\'s also about the story of this ill-fated ship that sank on her maiden voyage in a cold April night. I love knowing more about this ship in real life.\\n\\nIt is not surprising to find out that the director is kind of a perfectionist, because everything about this movie is just...perfect. The costumes and setting are spot on, the acting is very well done, the score is very moving and will make your heart bleed somehow, story is well-paced. It deserves every award it got.\\n\\nTitanic will forever be my favorite movie. I don\\'t think other movie will take over that throne. I remember that the nude scene kept me uncomfortable because I watched it with my father then.\\n\\nI feel sad every time I watch the rise and fall of luxury cruise ship. I was impressed with a captain and band left on the shinking ship. They accepted to be with the ship quietly. I was so afraid of the scene people came off from the careening ship. It traumatized me because I have acrophobia. If I watched it in 3D, it would be more scary. nan When looking back at Titanic you spot many faults with it and it doesn\\'t seem as good as when you first watched it or you look back and think how cheesy a lot of the scenes were but at that first time you see it I think everybody who watched it was completely embraced into the life of Jack and Rose. I was so excited seeing Titanic for the first time as it is The Gone With The Wind of our generation but with more special effects and more disaster like the Gone with the Wind was. If you ask someone to this day what they think of titanic then you will probably get the response you might expect and that is it was rubbish or it didn\\'t deserve the success that it got. I think what annoyed a lot of people about Titanic was Leonardo Di Caprio because of the teen madness that surrounded the movie at the time, but that doesn\\'t make it a bad film and it certainly doesn\\'t make Leonardo\\'s performance any less convincing than it was because he was top class and nothing more. When I was going to see Gangs of new York I asked friends to come along but they didn\\'t want to because of Di Caprio and if that is the reason why then they are without doubt narrow minded, it\\'s not his fault that my friends girlfriends would rather sleep with him and not them but let\\'s talk about the film.\\n\\nAs soon as the film starts its pretty obvious how the ending is going to turn out but it\\'s just not a story of Jack and Rose, it\\'s about everybody that was aboard the Titanic. These characters become more important obviously when the ship is sinking but it doesn\\'t stop you caring and wondering about who these people were. The scene where the young Irish mother is telling a poem to her children when they lay in their whilst the sea water over runs there deck just shows how cruel titanic was for sinking for letting that happen to people especially when there is nothing you can do about. It reminded me of how somebody is drowning but is not actually underneath the water but is waiting to die , and I think that\\'s what makes Titanic such an important movie about struggle and the strength to continue and fight for survival. These are hidden messages but seem obvious once you have watched so many times like I have and James Cameron maybe a lot of things but a bad director he isn\\'t as every film he has ever made apart from Piranha 2 have been masterpieces even True Lies can be seen as a comic action masterpiece as it has your villains, your hero\\'s and the love interest. Titanic is the most successful film of all time and there is no reason I think of why it shouldn\\'t be. When this film first came out, I was a Titanic buff and read as many books and saw as many documentaries on the actual ship as I could get my hands on. As I result, I realized the great lengths James Cameron went to in order to make \"Titanic\" as historically accurate as possible, in terms of the events of the ship itself. The film is perfectly done in that way, as it is the most realistic film about the Titanic ever made, in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is not nearly a perfect film, and I\\'ll tell you why. All the young girls in the world will kill me for this, but I feel that the film is far too focused on the fictional romance between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). This is not the first time a fictional story has found its way into a Titanic film (take the 1953 version with Clifton Webb for example). Being such a buff on the real Titanic, I did not like how so much of the film was focused on this story. What I really wanted was true historical facts about the tragedy shown on film. The story does not really need to be spiced up. It is tragic and fascinating, with tons of little interesting details, all on its own. It is truly a great story simply written by God himself. If you enjoy the romance between Jack and Rose, you\\'re not alone. That seems to be why most people love this film. Nevertheless, I found all of the facts about the Titanic in this film to be completely accurate and well-portrayed. It is a worthwhile film for just about anyone. Not worthy of all 11 Oscars, though. \"Good Will Hunting\" is what should have won that year. Of course, this does have that great original song \"My Heart Goes On,\" definitely worthy of its Oscar.\\n\\n*** out of **** nan Surely millions of people worldwide, a billion dollars and 11 Oscars can\\'t be wrong can they? Well yes, actually.\\n\\nThe problem with Titanic is that Cameron treats the whole enterprise like one of his action pictures, replete with the kind of staging you\\'d expect from that genre, but not alas, from a dramatisation of a genuine tragedy. Cameron has no faith in the emotional weight of the historical facts, and if we were being cynical we could also say no interest. This is an exercise in ego and directorial hubris from the outset, namely the idea that the writers fictional teenage romance - a story that never succeeds in rising above its clichÃ©d origins, is required to connect a contemporary audience to the events of 1912. You can see the logic because clearly the world\\'s worst peacetime maritime tragedy, 1,500 dead and the planets most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage isn\\'t an interesting enough story in itself. Subsequently the titular ship becomes merely a backdrop for a populist voyage into tedium. Just as you\\'d feel uneasy at the prospect of Michael Bay doing Jane Austen, Cameron doing period romance seems a little far fetched. Jack and Rose allow us to spend some time on the ship prior to its sinking and an impressive recreation it is but you\\'d quite like them to go away so we could see what the real passengers were up to. That he sustains momentum throughout this picture is despite his script, rather than because of it. His talent for pacing and moving a story forward serves him well in this respect but with fictional characters as one note as these, and with the ships real passengers reduced to supporting parts to bolster Cameron\\'s mills and boon narrative, we, unlike the real passengers are quite grateful to see the Iceberg emerging from the watery depths.\\n\\nOnce the ship hits the film moves up a gear and suddenly there is enough to sustain interest until the stilted syrup drenched epilogue. However, Cameron still stages the sinking like one giant set piece which saps the film of any emotional impact. A real tribute to the ship, rather than a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation would have taken an objective position and allowed the real events to unfold, giving us a chance to take in the full force of real events. This film concerns itself with fiction and doing so attempts to tell you what to feel and when to feel it. For me, this has the opposite effect and the scenes toward the end featuring Winslet and Decaprio are virtually unwatchable.\\n\\nThe production design is superb and its all very epic and grandiose but ultimately Titanic is a disappointment because it takes a real tragedy and turns it into populist entertainment. History for people not interested in History. If you think thats a harsh assessment then imagine a similar scenario applied to a retelling of the September 11th attacks and think how inappropriate that would seem. These people may be 90 odd years dead but they deserve more respectful treatment than this. Watch \"A night to remember\" (1958) for a far better depiction of events which was informed by accounts of the sinking not by one man who thought he had something to \\'add\\' to this terrible event. Avoid. In other words, this movie is something you must watch at least once before the day you die, you will NOT regret it.\\n\\nI hope this review was found helpful! :-) While a bit excessive and grandiose at times with some uneven sequencing (and I can see how some might think that about it), it is undeniably a very well-directed and executed film with fine acting and writing overall. I bought into the romance, the series of events, and details behind the portrayal of the sinking of the ship! It definitely wasn\\'t bad, nothing is really bad with Leonardo DiCaprio in it too!

But regardless, the costumes, acting, and storyline are all undeniably good and I have a feeling most people will at least enjoy this film. My Rating:* out of ****.\\n\\nTitanic is such a sensational looking film that it could be called the most expensive piece of eye candy. Like all films by James Cameron, Titanic is visually stunning from the sets to the special effects. Yet while Cameron\\'s films are great to look at they usually have more going for them than this one. Titanic was unworthy of many of its oscars and is one of the most overrated films of all time.\\n\\nThe first problem with this film is its script. James Cameron is not a professional at writing love stories and this clearly illustrates that point. The dialogue is corny and stupid. It makes me wonder why he didnt have Aliens invade Titanic. Yes the idea sounds horrible but I will take \"Get Away From Her You Bitch\" over \"Your gonna live on and your gonna have lots of babies\" I mean how corny and dumb is that.\\n\\nStrong Acting is a requirement for a film to succeed over a flat scrip. However, this is where Titanic fails again. I had no clue what Dicaprio was trying to do with this character. I am glad Spielberg taught him how to act in Catch Me If You Can. Kate Winslett is also horrible but her character is treated badly by the script. However, Billy Zane is actually quite good. Kathy Bates also holds her own, though her screentime is limited. Gloria Stewart is horribly irritating as the older Kate Winslett character.\\n\\nJames Cameron is a filmmaker who has great skills. Yet those skills are not on display here. His direction comes across as inept and uninspired. His skills here are better than his skills as a screenwriter for the film but thats not saying much.\\n\\nLike I said, Titanic succeeds as eye candy but not much else. The Sets are glorious looking. The cinematography is beautiful. The Costumes are breathtaking to behold. The Sound is top notch. The Visual Effects rank as some of the most impressive to come out of the 90s. Titanic is nice looking in pretty much everyway. If only everything else came into play Titanic would have been a good film. The visuals of the film were something not wasted in the making of this film.\\n\\nTitanic suffers from two other flaws: Unconvincing Chemistry and an OVERLONG running time. The chemistry between Leo and Kate was hailed as some of the best of the 90\\'s but I found it flatter than a pancake. Titanic is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy tooo long. It has a very uninteresting and sluggish two hours. The only excitement I got was seeing Kate Winslett\\'s boobs, which are more impressive than the film. During its final hour, the pace does pick up. The Sinking is a glorious sight yet Leo and Kate\\'s characters are still there. The last shot of the film is stupid, that has deleted scene written all over it.\\n\\nJames Cameron has a solid resume of films. He created Terminator I and II, Aliens, and True Lies. All these films showed the work of a skilled director, even though The Terminator gets the lowest rating it was a good film and showed a director with skill. Titanic shows a cocky asshole who should give his oscar to Curtis Hanson(director of the superior LA Confidential). This is easily the worst I have seen from Cameron. \"Titanic\" is obviously a big budget well-produced film even if the CGI is somewhat dated though good for its time. The leads, Kate and Leonardo, have great performances, delivering a powerful romantic yarn, however these positives of \"Titanic\" are offset by an over-indulgence of its own spectacle and grandiosity. This lack of self-restraint and efficient editing and storytelling really affect the second half of the film, making it a chore to get thru. Basically from the time the ship hits the iceberg the film suffers, it should have wrapped up with the catastrophe taking 20 minutes or so with a further 10 minute epilogue. But as it stands now at 3 and 1/4 hours it is 45 minutes too long or so. In summary, a famous film that probably appeals more to women, or young girls, than men, but it still holds up and is not bad even though it is a bit long and tedious. My rating: 6/10. I guess people love romance and melodrama. I found that this movie would only appeal to pre-pubescent girls with a storybook notion of romance and lovey-dovey mush. This movie is one of the most highly overrated in movie history, if only because it is the most successful film ever made, and the critics seem to sing with the choir of the global audience that paid over $1 billion to watch it. The love story is, as I said, pure mush, with a cardboard (yet effeminate) villain, played by Billy Zane. The story itself is a flimsy framework to show off the grand effect of the giant ship snapping to pieces and drowning doomed computer-animated passengers. The Celine Dion song for this is atrocious (it polluted the airwaves for much of 1997), and is just as sickening as this film. The characters are bland and uncompelling, the story slow and plodding, and the special effects are the only reason to enjoy this movie.\\n\\nThis movie belongs with the likes of any of those mushy 1980s romance or romantic comedy sort of films. For those who like melodrama, you may like \"Titanic.\" Most guys will want to pass on this film, unless your girlfriends force you to watch against your own will. I personally found the story of the Mexican props crew who built the pseudo-Titanic to be far, FAR, FAR more compelling than the sappy love story between Jack and Rose. Bloated neo-romantic crap are other fine discriptors of this movie. I honestly puke my guts out whenever the word titanic is mentioned. Hype, insulting plot, NON-Period sets, terrible lame dialogue, FAKE history all make this the worst blockbuster this side of phantom menace. Why do people like this movie so much? Really, pop-crap is what this is, nothing more. People proclaim James Cameron as some good director - this is the guy that directed \"Piranha Part Two: The Spawning\" for crying out loud! And if I see him on one more titanic type special I\\'m going to puke. Honestly, he already made a trillion dollars off of one shipwreck, can\\'t he leave it alone already? Titanic sucks, OK? TITANIC SUCKS Ok, who hasn\\'t seen this film? Since I just saw it tonight, I am unquestionably the last or next to last person to see it. Just on the chance that the last person to see it is reading this, then here goes.\\n\\nThere are very few things to quibble about in this movie. The sets are phenomenal. The ship is magnificent. How they could create such a marvel is beyond me. The story is the key, however. It really is a relatively simple boy meets girl, falls in love, saves her life, gives his sort of a tale. A Romeo and Juliet on water.\\n\\nThe performers are engaging, but I wouldn\\'t go so far as to say the acting was spectacular. DiCaprio was very good, but otherwise the acting was adequate. The story was extremely good and fit in well to the historical event.\\n\\nI only wouldn\\'t give this movie a 10 because it was a little depressing in the end and it was also a period piece - not my favorite genre. But otherwise it was truly a magnificent achievement. nan The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is â\\x80\\x93 was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received. I feel compelled to be the 900th or so person who\\'s probably commenting on this movie. Right now, this movie is about as popular as the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack was in 1981, and to this I say: Hogwash. No one seemed to mind in 1997, when people were lining up to see this movie three or four times. Now the same people are trashing it. Urgh. But it doesn\\'t surprise me. When it comes to movies, we tend to get brainwashed by other movielovers and critics, and if they imply \"we made a mistake--this movie is really awful,\" we tend to believe it. I watched Titanic in its entirety again the other day and I must go against the current grain and say that it is a great movie (or should I say, still a great movie). People who have not seen this movie on a large screen cannot say that they\\'ve seen this movie. Period. So go away. I will agree with most and say that the acting is pretty bad (and the movie did not pick up any Oscars in the acting category). James Cameron may be an arrogant jerk. And the screenplay is corny. But the sheer awesomeness of the film is what I remembered when I saw it on the big screen in 1997. Cameron, despite his personal faults, took us on that doomed luxury liner, literally transporting us back to 1912. Yes, it could be argued that movies like \"A Night to Remember\" were better examinations of Titanic\\'s final hours, and IMAX productions like Titanica had better footage of the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic. But Cameron\\'s \"kitchen sink\" approach to telling the story, which includes a trite but still rather sweet fictional love story,\\n\\nis what captivated audiences in 1997. Give this movie twenty years. People will rediscover its magic after the predictable backlash has worn off. Hey, even Alice Cooper is admitting today that Saturday Night Fever is a great album. From the first time I watched this movie, I knew it was always gonna be one of my favorites. From the beautiful direction and camera work and the music of choice to the amazing acting performed by Leo and Kate. It was a perfect choice to tell this story from a new but strong romance and love, giving the viewer a realization of how this must have been. When I watch this I feel happy, free and empowered but then scared for my own life just watching. It really gives you a picture of what it could have been like on the actual Titanic. This is art. The story of \\'Titanic\\' is so good that if written as mere fiction, it would be dismissed as preposterous.\\n\\nIn April of 1912, Titanic set out on its maiden voyage to the City of New York. \\'The Ship of Dreams\\' as it was called, was a floating palace for the wealthy elite, reportedly \\'unsinkable\\' by incorporating the latest in shipbuilding technology. After winning a pair of third-class tickets for himself and a friend in a poker game, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) looks forward to returning to his native America but finds himself drawn to a first-class passenger named Rose (Kate Winslet). She is the 16-year-old fiancÃ©e of Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) - a high-society gentleman that doesn\\'t like to lose - returning from her wedding in Europe; a match of convenience pushed by her mother to bolster the family\\'s faded coffers. After Jack\\'s chance meeting on the ship\\'s fantail with Rose threatening to hurl herself into the ocean, an unlikely romance begins. No sooner do they profess their love to each other, than an iceberg in the North Atlantic tests the character of everyone on board, from the ship\\'s captain to the poorest of the poor as it slowly iceberg rips the safe, stable deck out from beneath the characters.\\n\\nTitanic is an extraordinary motion picture â\\x80\\x93 a jaw-dropping feat of outstanding art direction, costume design and cinematography. The film captures the essence and decadence of the era, as well as the spirit and raw allure of the ship herself. Coupled with nearly seamless visual effects, James Cameron\\'s Titanic feels like a wholly real creation. Instead of treating the Titanic as a microcosm of society, Cameron makes the ship a vividly realized, fluid symbol of human destiny, mapping the different levels of the ship as levels of character, from the social graces of the salon to the sexual heat of the engine room. Created through a complex blend of partial sets, models and digital effects, Cameron\\'s Titanic is breathtaking in its wholeness, heartbreaking in its destruction. The film\\'s final hour portrays the sinking, not merely as spectacle, but as a series of harsh moral choices that must be made by all the characters as they decide who will live and who will die. But perhaps, the neatest thing about his filmmaking is the engaging way \\'Titanic\\' sucks us into what seems, on the surface, to be a magnetic romance, while underneath, there are dangerous currents of class consciousness and shoals of hubris. Yes, he does paint his story in broad strokes, and some of the dialogue is risible, but Leo and Kate sell the hell out of it, with their undeniable chemistry.\\n\\nTitanic isn\\'t just a great film, it\\'s a magnificent historical record of one of the most unfortunate disasters in the annals of human history, that is both poignant and personal. Generic story set against a historical tragedy. Pretty easy to fill in the gaps, add some (for the time) expensive advanced CGI and let the marketing department take over.\\n\\nI was able to ignore this movie for more than 2 decades, but alas, due to work related circumstances, I did eventually see it and I neither hate it nor like it. It\\'s just middle of the road generic filler fluff with no substance.\\n\\nI\\'m beginning to suspect Cameron\\'s most valued skill is choosing his marketing people, because his film are generally not that great.\\n\\nAnd yes.. There was indeed plenty of room... nan You can\\'t love but to be drawn into the movie. James Cameron really captured Titanic\\'s essence and brought us into the movie, onto the ship. The iceberg scene and the scenes were the Titanic is sinking were very dramatic, suspensful, and upsetting. 8.5 out of 10 I give to this movie. Judging by some of the comments I have read about this film from others: I would say that the makers of this film cannot win. If they did not try to get the get the actual historical facts right, I would be complaining. If they do, then the scriptwriters get it in the neck for not being imaginative enough.\\n\\nFor my part, I thought that the rich girl/poor Irishman story was wonderfully woven into the plot. Through the eyes of these two lovers, we are given a wonderful history lesson. We are introduced to the British caste system. We know that there were motor vehicles aboard, because they consummated their relationship in a car. When the ship is sunk we know that people were stuck in the water for far too long before the lifeboats came to rescue them; and, that, as a result, survivors at that stage were very rare. People who castigate all the literary devices used in this film should really lighten up: they are educational devices.\\n\\nThere may be a few things about this film that are historically incorrect. For instance in the trick photography scene, where the captain\\'s cup of Russian tea turns into the ship itself, there is smoke coming from all four funnels, even though everybody knows that one of the funnels - presumably the one that capsized - was a ventilator.\\n\\nThe only bit of real criticism would be the music. It might have been better if the music were more timeless rather than the transitory voice of that Canadian singer whose name I have forgotten already. I\\'ve already seen \"Titanic\" four times. The first time I saw it I didn\\'t pay attention at the mistakes, so I loved it and I would give it a 9 out of 10, or even 10. The second time I began to pay more attention, specially at Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s acting. This time I saw with my mother and she didn\\'t like it at all. I would give it a 8. The third time I saw at school and I found more mistakes- a 7. The fourth and last (I hope so)- a 6 out of 10. I think that\\'s my final vote.\\n\\nThere are a lot of good things and a lot of bad things about \"Titanic\". Kate Winslet is a great actress, the art direction, the costumes, the special effects... Oh! Perfect! However, James Cameron change the actors (except Kate Winslet) into dolls. We can see this in Billy Zane\\'s and Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s acting. And the script is so poor... You know... Cameron was thinking he was the king of the world when he did this film. And that\\'s the result: \"Titanic\" is so-so.\\n\\nPS: I don\\'t see anything special about the sound track. Well... I hate Celine Dion... I may not make myself popular with this statement but I hate Titanic. One reason is that it is far too long for a Hollywood movie. It spends most of its time waffling on and on and on. I went to see it in the cinema when it released it 97, it didn\\'t impress me then it doesn\\'t impress me now. I have liked James Cameron\\'s previous work like Terminator and True lies but he has really disappointed this time around.\\n\\nNow onto the good points. The last scene was so moving and the song My heart will go on is one of my favourites. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were very good in their roles. I feel that it should have been made like a documentary rather than a standard 90\\'s disaster movie. On the other hand there are millions of titanic fans and I have been known to have unusual tastes in movies. Go and see it and decide for yourself There are many who say Titanic is \"overrated\", \"over-hyped\" or some might inexplicably go as far to say \"boring\" and \"pointless\". The hardly arguable biggest blockbuster of the 90s, grossing near 2 billion at the box office and winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, has attained some hate from people over the years, people who love to hate this movie for everything they so wrongly think it is not and never will be. It has, however, attained a very positive social status among a lot of people whom their hearts were captured by this masterpiece. Those people can see just how magnificent of a movie this really is, and how underrated a classic it appears to be in today\\'s film society; a dazzling and striking accomplishment in itself and never overlooked, but unfairly maligned by many.\\n\\nThe movie, aside from being set on the Titanic and called Titanic, actually has a love story that renders up most of the movie time, as most would already know. This love story, is positively brilliant in every sense of the word. I am always amazed and captivated to watch it play out on screen, because Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who were furiously snubbed out of Best Actor/Actress awards, have wonderful chemistry, giving me chills in lots of scenes, and they both separately give incredulous performances that enthrall and charm every step of the way as well. These two characters\\' strong likability, along with James Cameron\\'s directing and the entirely fascinating special effects make this movie something much more than mere entertainment. The movie is excellently executed in the best manner it could be, the Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart present day story being very interesting as well, and a lot of the film\\'s aspects are quite simply riveting and awe-inspiring whether it\\'s the love story, the intensity in all the performances or the infamous, brilliantly portrayed sinking and sets that give true heart to the story of the Titanic and shows it\\'s revelation quite undeniably like any other film on the subject.\\n\\nWhile \"My Heart Will Go On\", receiving the Academy Award for Best Original Song, has attained some criticism from people as well, it makes the perfect score and theme song for every scene it is used in regarding the movie, especially the climax, which has had millions in tears, had me in tears, and always has me in tears when I watch it, even if it is not the saddest movie of all time, because it isn\\'t. It\\'s a film about love, a film about disaster, a film about memories, and it is beautifully shown how all of those three attributes tie into peoples\\' lives, but I am not melancholy, I am merely pleased with how stunning of a film it is, and how remarkably well it has held up over the years, not being overthrown by any blockbusters in recent years in likes of quality, in my honest opinion. James Cameron, even if not one of my favorite directors, is very talented and it shows with this movie. I do not understand a lot of the reasons why so many hate this, or do not find it as remarkable of a film as fans like me do, but I ensure you, this movie will always have a place in my heart, and will go down as a classic, already has even and will contine to whether haters like it or not, because of how many people were touched by it and are still touched by it. Underrated, powerful, breath-taking movie that, since holding up in quality on every watch, I intend to love for many more years to come. Titanic is one of those movies that will have to be rereleased in the theaters periodically, because you miss a lot on the small screen. Even so, Cameron\\'s fantastically detailed canvas still amazes me. The movie is filled with images you can never forget. It\\'s the work of a great visual artist. I saw Titanic in the theater with an ex girlfriend and although I didn\\'t cry, I could see why many people did. The film has alot of breathtaking effects and James Cameron has done a great job of replicating the doomed ship. Kate Winslet is absolutely beautiful. The movie was a little too long and the whole heart of the ocean storyline was uninspired. The acting was pretty good but Leonardo Dicaprio is an overrated candyass hack actor. The whole love story could have been morepassionate if it wasnt so cheesy. Took awhile but once the ship went down, the chaos ruled. *** out of **** This is one of the best movie ever made in the history of hollywood. this is the best and wonderful movie of the all time.it is my favorite movie from harry potter and the lord of the rings.it deserves to be rated as 10/10. leonardo dicaprio is the best actor in my life and his role in this movie is just stunning,best movie of all the ages ,and this is evergreen.this movie is my life.inspires me all the time toward my future and towards my dream kate winslate is so beautiful and best pal of leo.this movie is so awesome.epic adventure,great destruction,lovable romance.ahw..... can\\'t describe this master piece in my words because it is preserved in my heart for the rest of my life. This movie is one of the most beautifully designed portrayals of a story that everybody has heard about. Titanic is the kind of movie where you either love it or you hate it. There\\'s really no in between.\\n\\nI love this film. I definately don\\'t hate it, and since it is close to being one of my most favorite films, I\\'ll go all the way and say that I do indeed love it. With so many mixed comments about how it was so awful, or how it was the best film in the history of filmmaking, I just have to comment on it.\\n\\nI am pretty confident in saying that everybody has seen this. Most people complain about how it had such a big budget and that the sinking part of the movie was so unreal. Others say that the cast was made up of the worst actors possible. Let me break my opinions down into different sections of the movie.\\n\\nI thought that the cast did a very well job. When the time that Titanic was at the theaters, there was so much hype about Leonardo DiCaprio. After a while, the publicity was a little too much and it started to become old news. I agree that his part as Jack Dawson was an excellent role. Watching him for three hours + isn\\'t too bad either. Kate Winslet gave a good breakthrough performance as Rose and I liked her style as to how she made the character come alive. The only problem that I had with her was that towards the end where it was focused just on her, she became a real snooty b _ _ _ _. That\\'s okay, I guess that it was good for her to act in that certain mood. The entire cast, and I mean every last person, did an absolutely spectacular job. Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Victor Garber, and everyone else that was involved were really good.\\n\\nThe writing was terrific. A lot of time and thought went into this script. After hearing that it was over three hours long, I had no intention on seeing it. But I went and saw it and was especially impressed with the writing that James Cameron put into it. Being that it is such a long movie, the script had to hold up well for the entire time. Not once did I think that it was boring or did I ever want to skip a part. That is one of the problems with most newer movies. Too many unnecessary parts are added in to take up time. Titanic was fine with everything pertaining to the script.\\n\\nThe plot was a little original but still held my attention. A first class girl falling for a steerage boy and vice versa. Each scene and situation that the two were in really made it enjoyable. Both actors played these parts good and made it somewhat believable that they were star-crossed lovers. One problem that I had with the plot was that the meeting and getting to know each other was a little on the hurried side. They meet, fall in love, etc. We know the story.\\n\\nMaybe the special effects were the majority of the movie considering that the second half deals with the sinking of the ship. A lot of computers and a ton of money helped make the film a success. I\\'m not one for movies where special effects take over the entire film but there were enough in Titanic to where it still stayed realistic. Plus they were really good.\\n\\nA big part of the film that I liked was the music and score for it. After a couple of songs, they all started to sound somewhat similar, but I was still able to get along with it.\\n\\nJust a little word on what I think the most annoying scene was. It was...the famous \"I\\'m the king of the world\" line. It wasn\\'t awful, but it was a minor part that could have been left out.\\n\\nI know that I\\'m forgetting something and as soon as I submit this, I\\'m going to remember it. Anyway, my final words are that this was a over-hyped, not overrated film that is still good to watch every now and again. I think that it was a little bad that Cameron and his crew set aside as much money as they did, just for one film. I am glad that the gained all of it back plus more. A little long, maybe ease up on the FX, and...that\\'s about it. It was a very good movie. However, to get some ORIGINAL lines and writing, be sure to see A Night to Remember, and when it\\'s available, see Titanic: The CBS Miniseries. I was kind and gave this thing a three. I\\'m glad to see that I have lots of company in bum rapping this over rated film. Sure, the special effects were spectacular and thoroughly milked throughout the last hour of the film. Gads! I thought Kate and Leonardo would never get off the ship!\\n\\nYou can certainly see where the money went. Besides the spectacular sinking of the ship, extras must have found this a bonanza, along with hordes of stunt persons.\\n\\nTo such fine actors and Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslow, this schlock must have been a breeze, hardly up to the demands of their Shakespeare portrayals.\\n\\nThe usual bit about the lower classes not just being as good but even better than the upper classes was predictable, of course. I\\'m sure she\\'d just love tossing if beers in a pub for the rest of her life.\\n\\nWell, enough of this sarcasm/ I could go on, but you get the point. This film will go down in history as just a groundbreaking film, aside from anything else. When it came out, you wanted to see it. The way they advertised it, how could you not? We\\'re all guilty of morbid curiosity and love the irony of a ship so grand in scale and deemed \"Unsinkable\" to so many could actually do the unthinkable and pretty much capsize. It fascinates all of us. James Cameron did an excellent job of pulling this together. They wasted a lot of water that some 3rd world countries could have used, but still a good job. I liked the flashback idea, but it\\'s pretty obvious the chick woulda been dead in most real life circumstances and Kate Winslet doesn\\'t play a convincing 17 year old girl.\\n\\nI liked the true ending of the ship. It actually went down in 2 pieces rather than in all one form as other versions have implied. It kinda makes this movie the definitive version in a way, because it broke the standard. The climax was for the men. To this day, all my boyfriend talks about is the guy hitting the propeller and spinning madly to his icy death. But, the love story was definitely for the women. It was a little pretentious to think that she would have followed this man in the 4 days that she knew him, but hey, that\\'s Hollywood. Rose was a nice insert as a person in history, but it seems fairly fantastic today that this story would ever happen. Jack was a stupid twit of a man that had no prospects and we\\'re supposed to believe that she would run away with this cat? Oooh, rich bastard who\\'s hot or poor twit whose only appeal is that he lives under a bridge? Oh, the choices. His nomadic existence was suppose to charm us, but all I saw was a bum. And look what happened to him. He was supposed to be so used to cold water and whatnot and the boy froze like a fishstick. If I were her, I woulda went back to Cal and said, \"My bad about that spitting thing\".\\n\\nI loved the character of Mr. Andrews. A little stupid for wanting to die with his creation, but to each his own. I can\\'t believe that people actually wanted to go down with the ship and kept playing music and whatnot. Absolutely saddening that they were missing the big picture. Ship sinking. Need to get off. I found the music inspiring and we\\'ll always have Celine Dion\\'s song to drag us back to 1997: the year it wouldn\\'t stop playing. I never really felt the terror of being on this ship though. I found that people had plenty of opportunities to get off, but they were just too damn stuck up to try anything. Only the 3rd class folks you felt sorry for. They actually tried to keep them on the boat. You felt bad for them, because they were the ones that were gonna die, because of their low station. However, I didn\\'t have sympathy for first class folks. And where were the 2nd class people? It was like they didn\\'t exist. I guess they weren\\'t instrumental to the plot, but I wouldn\\'t have minded seeing them at times.\\n\\nAnd of course, we\\'re all a little mad at the old lady dropping the necklace in the water. I know it\\'s supposed to be poignant, but give it to the granddaughter or somebody. Brock should have gotten it. I felt bad for him because he was like the rabbit from the \"Trix\" commercials. Just let him have it for goodness sakes! He\\'s only devoted his entire adult life to it. No, little old crackpot decides to toss it overboard. I woulda made her go in after it...anywho, good film over all. We\\'ll all remember it when we\\'re old as \"that\" film. This was a very good movie that was both entertaining and sad, that had a great love story. The special effects were great as was the acting. 10!! Rated PG-13 for disaster violence, language, nudity, and sensuality. While I enjoy this movie historicalwise and the plot of it as well, the ending leaves me depressed. I dislike the fact that Jack froze to death. I understand that James Cameroon had to make most of the passengers die because that is what happened in reality. What he didn\\'t need to do, however, was make Jack die since he was a main character. If I produced this movie, I would have made Cal freeze to death instead and Jack would marry Rose. The present time would have both Jack and Rose as an elderly couple talking about what had happened. Another thing that bothers me is how these third class passengers were treated. The crewmen wouldn\\'t allow them to go up to the deck until all the first and second class people were loaded onto the lifeboats. After breaking down the door, the third class passengers fled to the deck. Some of them, however, gave up and stayed down in the steerage. The scene where the Irish mother is telling her children a story to put them to sleep is very sad. I really hated Rose\\'s mother Ruth. She was very nasty and shallow. The ship is sinking, many people are dying, and all she cares about is that the lifeboats are seated according to class? What a b****! The only reason she wanted Rose to marry Cal was because they were broke and Cal was rich.\\n\\nI still enjoy this movie, as I had mentioned earlier, but it really isn\\'t something I want to watch everyday. It certainly isn\\'t something you want to watch before you go to bed. If you do, you should watch something funny afterwards. This is considered one of the best made films of all time. James Cameron outdoes himself big time, but this won\\'t be the last epic he ever makes. The story of the Titanic like you\\'ve never seen it before. Epicness beyond anything reachable.\\n\\nThe story is told in a flashback perspective, with Rose Dawson, a survivor of the Titanic, telling it to a group of scientists, and her granddaughter, telling about her experience on the Titanic, leading up to the fateful night where it would meet its historical doom. It also circles around her life changing star cross love affair with Jack Dawson, (Leonardo DiCaprio) another person on the Titanic.\\n\\nBegins with one of the greatest music scores of all time by James Horner, and then slowly takes us back to the very beginning. Goes incredibly smooth with the camera movement, making each and every individual scene epic as ever. The performances are beautiful as ever, with Billy Zane, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, and Leo DiCaprio leading a brilliant cast.\\n\\nThe first half is getting everything acquainted on the ship, and introducing all the characters, and setting the plot. The second half consists entirely of the boat sinking, which is very graphic. The visual effects are mind-blowing, with excellent and detailed parts of the ship. The music, editing, and setting really capture every single feeling and thought raced through the actual minds of the real people.\\n\\nOne of three movies in history to win 11 Oscars. The others being Ben- Hur, and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I had to watch the movie five more times until I finally managed to without crying. Its a real tear fest. Almost everybody in this film is crying. Its depressing as ever, but in a good way. It brilliantly captures the terror of the people. Its hard for a film to do that. James Cameron wasn\\'t screwing around when he made this. Everything in this movie is excellent. Nothing is in fault, absolutely nothing. Everything is 100% accurate!\\n\\nThis film killed at the box office, which it well should have. Its a film that will go down in history. A film that nobody will ever forget, and will always cherish every little moment this film brings. An entertaining movie that everybody seems to have seen (and I admit, the film has that somewhat nostalgic atmosphere in it) but has simple characters with a simple, predictable cliche love story. I don\\'t know what the huge fuss is about, there isn\\'t that much special about it other than that the movie is way too overrated. This Hollywood tour de force is too mainstream for its own good. Great visuals, expensive sets, great hype, but ultimately shallow, it perhaps does not deserve all the hate if often gets, but by all means it did not deserve the hype with which it was initially met. So, in reality, a mixed bag. Hollywood has produced much worse and also had its honor pieces. This moneymaker is neither of the extremes, but it is certainly too soulless manipulative and shallow to be considered a master piece, but when stripped off its dumbest pandering it has some decent side to it, mainly of the technical nature. Actually reading a lot of the previous reviews (lots of them) has restored my faith in humanity.\\n\\nI half expected to read \\'best film ever\\' which pops up far too often for average films that hollywood rams down people\\'s throats.\\n\\nThis film was so poor. I\\'m generally a fan of Cameron and normally his writing is very good, but the sub plot to this film was appalling. Why did Rose, who was meant to be English played by an English actress have a bad American accent. Why did every Englishman/woman on the boat (which incredibly was an English ship you know, not American as the film tries to push) an evil nasty character.\\n\\nThe acting was probably the worst in film history and the love story was so silly and badly done. All the scenes on the boat looked like Hollywood stage sets.\\n\\nIt\\'s very disturbing that a film like this can win Oscar recognition. It was bad enough that Braveheart won an Oscar, but that was much better than this.\\n\\nFilm making and hype at its worst from a normally reliable director. Wow, well what can I say that hasn\\'t already been said. these are some of my favorite actors and they are in a tragic love story!! How amazing! Leo and Kate have chemistry that is so perfect and so sweet. In the movie they really feel like they are friends that grow into a loving relationship. The imagery is gorgeous and the story has such heart! It\\'s still so terrible that this is a true event that has happened. I couldn\\'t imagine being on the ship when all of this was happening. There are times that it was slow but other than that I will always love this movie. It will always be a favorite! Leo is such a great character in this movie and he is such a likable character and Kate is as well. nan beautiful film. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers\\' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is \"better\" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. For edward shossor hand 7.6. SHAME: This is masterpiece of Hollywood. 11 Oscar for a poor 7.2!!! Shame. nan I saw \"Titanic\" in a first-run theater in 1997 and loved it. I had not watched it again until today because I had made the mistake -- and it was a mistake -- of believing that the enthusiasm for the film came entirely from teenaged girls and desperate housewives. BZZZT! Wrong. I am a man of, ahem, mature years, and was deeply moved, both in 1997 and again today.\\n\\nThe drama of this wildly romantic tale is greatly enhanced by the presence of the ominous tragedy that was the TITANIC disaster. Nobody uses visual images, enhanced by special effects better than James Cameron and \"Titanic\" is his masterpiece, it seems to me. Every frame of the film is beautiful and reflects the $200 million that were spent in making it.\\n\\nNow let\\'s talk about why I think that this film should work for everyone. First, there is no real-life disaster that was more poignant than the TITANIC sinking, so the movie rises far above the romantic disaster genre because it tells much of the real life story of the tragedy. Second, the movie, \"Titanic\" is simply awesome to both look at and listen to. My enjoyment was enhanced because I got to see it on a big screen high definition TV and listen to it on a first class 5.1 home theater sound system. Finally, \"Titanic\" just works. If you pay attention and think it will break your heart, I promise. This is going to be a short review for Titanic.\\n\\nPlot: The plot of the film is really amazing. If you want a three-hour long love story, this is the movie for you. Another movie worth watching is \"A Walk to Remember\", starring Mandy Moore and it is a movie that I have seen and it is spectacular. The entire 196-minute picture centers around two lovers: one rich girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater and poor artist Jack Dawson (portrayed nicely by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during it\\'s ill-fated maiden voyage.\\n\\nCharacters and Story: James Cameron wrote a story that shines out, but the dialogue is very clichÃ©d and cheesy in a few areas. The characters are all well portrayed and I give to the two main actors, also credit to Billy Zane, who plays Cal, he is the character you want to hate. Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill, Frances Fisher, Johnathan Hyde, Danny Nucci, David Warner, Bill Paxton and the late Gloria Stuart, who plays older Rose in this film and she should have deserved an Oscar.\\n\\nVisuals: This is where the movie shines. James Cameron wanted to make a movie about the Titanic and it shows, with it\\'s $200 million dollar budget and he made this movie historically accurate as possible. The ship\\'s sinking scene is one of the coolest thing they could do with CGI and practical effects and it is awesome.\\n\\nSound / Music: The music is awesome and fantastic. James Horner composed a musical score and he is fantastic. The film\\'s theme song, \"My Heart Will Go On\", performed by Celine Dion and I love it and a lot of people has did covers of this song and I listen to this version and it was fantastic.\\n\\nEnjoyment: TITANIC is a good classic, epic romantic disaster film that I have no problem watching once in a while. The film won 11 Oscars including Best Director, Best Picture and Best Original Song. It made $2 billion dollars worldwide and it is just fantastic. 10/10. This is going to be a short review for Titanic.\\n\\nPlot: The plot of the film is really amazing. If you want a three-hour long love story, this is the movie for you.

(assuming he doesnt have the id or eq of a 14yo)\\n\\na generous 2 Based on a true story the film re-lives the horrors of when the real Titanic sank. As well as that, a poor boy( Leonardo DiCaprio)strikes up a romance with a rich daughter(Kate Winslet). It was one of the movie that seemed so real-in breath taking detail. As I said earlier, I thought I wouldn\\'t like this film, but once i watched it last night, I can\\'t blame other people for complaining about it only getting a 7 out of 10 (on average). Billy Zane plays a great role as the controlling boyfriend. There is something special about this movie. VERY special. Sometimes the special effects are a bit cheesy, but its convincingly covered up by the extremely tense scenes. This film made me feel extremely depressed but at the same time I couldn\\'t look away.\\n\\nThe acting is marvelous as well as the make up, trying to look like the clothes of old.\\n\\nJames Cameron- I raise my glass to you as although this story is based on a true story-it will be remembered for a very long time.\\n\\nA classic.\\n\\n10/10. When this movie came out everybody went and saw it. One year later, everybody was making fun of it. Okay, this was not a bad movie, however, it got way too much attention. And now there should be regrets. Because this was so popular for three months, we made it the highest grossing film of all time, something that even Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings couldn\\'t beat, and it bumped such good films like Star Wars and ET off the list. Plus, 14 Oscar nominations and twelve wins for that!! The only thing that was fantastic about it, was the visula effects and music. Titanic is not the greatest movie of all time ( except box office). It is not the greatest movie of 1997. The flaws are many: 1) We know the end to Titanic. That makes the last hour and a half amazingly boring. 2) James Cameron trivialized it by using two fictional characters. 3) Not many of the performances were that great ( I liked Paxton, Bates, and Stewart) 4) Overlong I admit I enjoyed this film. The grandeur of it all was impressive. The fact that James Cameron let this film get to a 200 million dollar budget is also very impressive. However, once the grandeur is taken away there really isn\\'t much left. The plot is a simple romance. And since the story is so predictable, it puts some heavy pressure on a three hour film.\\n\\nThe direction is superb. My distaste for this film doesn\\'t extend to James Cameron\\'s technical direction. His technical direction is on par with Spielberg\\'s. However, his human/emotional part of that mix doesn\\'t rate very well. The acting also is not consistent. I didn\\'t find DiCaprio\\'s performance bad, but his character seemed to be very easy to play and wasn\\'t that complicated. Winslet, who\\'s performance in Heavenly Creatures stunned me, is mainly okay here. The best performances belonged to Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates.\\n\\nThe score also rates with the best, and the soundtrack is one I highly recommend.\\n\\nIn the end, I think this film is more comparable to \"Cleopatra\" than to \"Gone With Wind\". The budget and the problems making the film end up being more interesting and more entertaining than the film itself.\\n\\nDid this film deserve best picture? No. But it\\'s nomination was also like \"Cleopatra\\'s\" nomination. The big budget and the absolute vastness of the film was enough. Though \"Titanic\" didn\\'t deserve to win best picture it is still a very well done movie that will entertain anyone who watches it. The visual effects in this film are astounding and absolutely beleivable. Alot of people say this film is overrated but I dissagree. Like I said not the best film ever but entertaining anyways. James Cameron is a masterful director and I hope he announces his next movie soon. \"Terminator 2\" still ranks as his best film though. One thing about Titanic is for sure: Is the most successful film in the 20th century. It made a kazillion at the box office and picked a pile of Oscars and other awards. The Titanic craze grew to the point of making people sick of it (including myself).\\n\\nIt\\'s no surprise why a lot of people hate this film as much as the people who love it: The lack of chemistry of the DeCaprio and Winslet couple. The laughable acting of DeCaprio. And finally, the cliche and often ridiculous dialog (In certain part of the movie, the chip was in climax-sinking mode, people were dying like flies. The first thing our heroine occurred to say was \"This is where we first met!\").\\n\\nDespite the movie\\'s flaws Titanic manages to hit a nerve on us all. The experience is completely immersive and the film\\'s last hour makes up for all the romance rubbish. It\\'s no question it\\'s a very well done movie and its worth every penny people paid to see it. Back in 1997 when Titanic was released, I didn\\'t think it would ever earn back the money it cost. After all, it was basically a love story/drama set on a ship that sunk. Not exactly a crowd pleaser like say, Armageddon. Then it came out, blasted to number one at the box office, and received 14 Oscar nominations - so I felt I had to see it. Coming out from the cinema I had that wow feeling. The one you get when you\\'re so caught up in what\\'s going on in the film, that you forget about everything else. Three hours just flies by. In all, I\\'ve seen it three times at the movies and another eight times on video, and I still get that sense of awe when I see it.\\n\\nTitanic was a phenomenon. It\\'s the sort of ground breaking cinema experience that doesn\\'t come around very often. Sure, the script isn\\'t the most original ever - it\\'s almost structured like a daytime soap (poor boy meets rich girl, engaged to evil guy). But another classic like Gone with the Wind isn\\'t exactly the stuff of deep thoughts either. What they have in common is that they\\'re grand spectacles that give the audience 100% entertainment in an expensive wrapping.\\n\\nLove, drama, disaster, action, and suspense - something for almost everyone. All done by extremely talented and gifted people, who could produce a visual experience on a scale rarely seen earlier. And in the middle of this two lead actors with a chemistry between them so crucial in order for the story to work beyond its one dimensional characters.\\n\\nThe film may have suffered a pretty severe critical backlash (just look at the rating here on IMDB), but there\\'s a reason why it made almost twice the amount of money at the box office as the number two film. It\\'s pure and simple entertainment, that shows just how fun it can be to go to the movies. [10/10] nan Titanic is probably the most unlikely successful films of all time. It really was no kind of provocative theme at center. It was quite simply an epic, and an epic LOVE STORY at that. Yet, this film went on to be the most successful movie of all time, both in the box office and the awards seasons.\\n\\nThe movie does what many people thought would be absolutely impossible- It takes you back to the Titanic and truly captures exactly what it must have felt like when the \"unsinkable\" ship went down. Through a love story that moves everyone who sees it, characters that are diverse and fascinating, and probably the best cinematography ever put on screen, it makes you feel about this story in a way you\\'ve never felt before. And that\\'s what makes it so amazing. It changed the way people looked at this story forever. It made them truly understand the tragedy of what happened that night.\\n\\nThe acting is fantastic. Leonardo Dicaprio does a fine job and was very under-appreciated for this performance. However, the reason for that is because no one could take their eyes off of Kate Winslet. This movie made her what she is today. Her performance is still fantastic as you watch it even now. The movie was hers from the moment she came on screen.\\n\\nIt\\'s true that it is, at heart, a love story, but it\\'s not only about the two central characters of Jack and Rose. To me, the real love story is about the Titanic itself. Before I saw this movie, it was an interesting story and that was all. Because of this movie, and the vividness it portrayed, it is a story I\\'ll never forget. It\\'s become a story that will never die in the hearts of people, and the movie is what truly did that. It changed the way that people thought of Titanic forever.\\n\\nI think Bill Paxton\\'s character said it best right at the end: \"All my life I\\'ve thought of nothing but Titanic, but I never really got it until now.\" I understand Mr. Paxton- I feel the same way. An absolutely fantastic film, and probably one of the best ever made. 9/10 stars!\\n\\nJay Addison nan nan \"Titanic\" gave me too much touch. Shocked by the thrilling scenes, he occasionally left a line on the soft sandy beach in his heart. But now, it was completely moved by it, and it was deeply imprinted into the memory. Even when the fireworks were set off on New Year\\'s Eve, I saw the fireworks rising, blooming, and falling in the dark night sky. I remembered the distress signal sent by the captain when the Titanic was killed. The fireworks also rose to the vast starry sky, bloomed, and landed on the infinite sea. And the naive little girl on the boat smiled happily because she saw the beautiful fireworks. I still feel heartache when I think of it. People\\'s feelings will always get deeper and deeper with age. After many years, the 11-time Oscar-winning \"Titanic\" can still travel through time and space and shake people\\'s hearts. One of the well-known ships that became an disaster at sea was the Titanic. It sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea. Disaster struck when the ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink. The passengers of the Titanic were trying to survive. Many of them died. Some of them were in lifeboats. Now, James Cameron brings back the mighty ship. In his film Titanic, a man named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He goes on the Titanic after winning an poker game. Also on board an beautiful passenger, played by Kate Winslet and her fiancÃ©, played by Billy Zane. DiCaprio and Winslet fall for each other in love as the Titanic ventures out to sea. Then, the iceberg hits the Titanic and that is when chaos begins. Passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts to sink. The ship\\'s sinking isn\\'t about the passengers screaming and panicking, but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship. Real documentary footage of the real Titanic appear on the opening credits. Winslet\\'s character Rose, now old, is played by Gloria Stuart, who remembered what happen that night. The movie\\'s visionary of the Titanic sinking is wonderful made with the special effects. As for Winslet and DiCaprio, they have great performances as Rose and Jack. The film itself is a tragedy of what happened. Titanic is one of the best films of 1997. An great, true Hollywood Epic. â\\x98\\x85â\\x98\\x85â\\x98\\x85â\\x98\\x85 4 stars. I was watching football on my Sky go and titanic was on in the background. As the ship hit the iceberg you know that it\\'s getting to the best part so my attention soon switched.\\n\\nSeriously one of the best, most iconic films ever. Beautiful couple. Disasterous circumstances. \\'Can\\'t take your eyes off the screen\\' moments. A true classic. Well...everyone saw this movie! Maybe not EVERYONE, but mostly everyone! I was impressed by this movie the first time I saw it in the theatres, and thank God I saw it in the beginning when it first came out before the movies became crowded by Leonardo DiCaprio and movie fans. I loved the portrayal of the real-life wealthy passengers like the Unsinkable Molly Brown, the captain, John Jacob Astor, the Countess, just to name a few. The set was amazing and took my breath away! This movie really explains a lot about the whole experience of the famous Titanic, and when I see pics of it lying there under the sea, it\\'s pretty freaky and scary. It\\'s like a ghost ship under sea, but above sea, and for those who were there, the ship was a real wonder!\\n\\nI thought it was very generous of James Cameron to have that special moment of silence at the Academy Awards back in 1998 when he was accepting the award for Best Picture, and who knew that a movie such as \"Titanic\" would ever come alive on the big picture. This movie is dramatic, romantic, funny (in it\\'s own way), sexy, and magical all together. It\\'s every genre mixed into one! That\\'s why I call this movie the best movie I ever seen in my whole life! It\\'s sad to hear people whine about this movie saying that if it doesn\\'t have good effects, it\\'s a bad movie. Then they say it has weak acting and a predictible storyline. First of all: predictible story? Hello....people ?....did we all suddenly forget this was a real event? I actually had people get mad at me when I told them the ship sank. Then there\\'s criticism of the bad effects. I personally have never been more convinced in seeing the ship break apart. You really feel like you are on the boat itself. The visual effects are truly stunning. And for those that are so concentrated on effects alone, I\\'d like to see them do better. This is a wonderful yet tragic love story with sub plots of societal segregation and female opression. Those that think on a higher plane and truly understand love, sacrifice and loss will like this movie. Those that criticize it forget that 1,500 people lost their lives in this tragedy, and I don\\'t think the dead would give a darn about the effects or the acting. \"Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one.\" It\\'s time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.\\n\\nFirst of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film\\'s set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I\\'ve seen.\\n\\nHowever, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it\\'s intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we\\'re watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose\\'s fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.\\n\\nSo aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it\\'s ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It\\'s called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.\\n\\nTitanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It\\'s a romance; it\\'s a disaster movie; it\\'s an action film; it\\'s got a sense of humour and wit; it\\'s a period drama; it\\'s a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you\\'re ever likely to get. nan How could I not give this film a 10/10. Sure, there is some corny dialogue and some romance that gets a bit too sentimental for my taste, but that doesn\\'t hold this film back from greatness. It\\'s the best romance film ever made and will have you tearing up no doubt. Once the iceberg is hit, the film goes to another level. The already well established characters are thrown into this tragedy that had me glued to the screen. Cameron\\'s production is far ahead of it\\'s time and deserves all the praise that it gets. The ending is also something that really makes me think about life and death, as a philosophical thinker. Having a dreamlike state after death and seeing what you truly care about...meeting up with the ones you love...is heaven. It\\'s such a beautiful ending and gives me chills everytime. It\\'s almost too easy to bash this film. So I\\'ll just paraphrase what James Cameron himself said on TV one night about the \"pitch\" meeting for the film...\"I got an idea for a film about a boat. It\\'s about 3 hours long and nothing much is gonna happen for about 2 1/2 hours. Then everbody dies and there\\'s no chance for a sequel. And by the way..it\\'s gonna cost you about $200 million to make it. Whaddya think, guys?\"\\n\\nTruth be told..the first half hour or so (the Bill Pullman stuff with actual footage) ain\\'t bad, but nothing I haven\\'t already seen on the Discovery Channel.\\n\\nI\\'ll still take Cameron\\'s \"The Abyss\" every day and twice on Sunday. The guy directs a pretty neat little action film. It\\'s just that I like my disposable love stories served with a side order of humor..and maybe some actual \"acting\". You know. The stuff that actors do in movies? In \"The Abyss\", Ed Harris and the gang got into their characters enough to give the movie a nice kick. Leo and Co. are reduced to playing second fiddle to blue screen effects.\\n\\nAnd here\\'s another shining moment for the Oscars. Ranks right up there with the Milli Vanilli Grammy Award in the \"What the hell were they thinking, anyway?\" category. nan My initial thoughts when first sitting down to watch Titanic at the cinema were,\"So we already know the ending, so how good can it be?\"\\n\\nWell, after the first ten minutes of crap, the true story unfolds and the story of Rose(Kate Winslet) and Jack(Leonardo Di Caprio) is told.\\n\\nTitanic has an all star cast including the afore mentioned doomed lovers, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates(Misery), Bill Paxton(A Simple Plan) and Jonathon Hyde(Anaconda). Each of the cast puts in a near perfect performance, and the story is surprisingly good. Both Winslet and Di Caprio deserved more recognition for their stunning performances as did James Cameron for his brilliant direction.\\n\\nOn a whole, the film was an excellent version of the Titanic tragedy. It was later proven that Leo\\'s character, Jack Dawson was actually on the Titanic. Rating=4/5 nan Titanic is one of those movies that stays with you for life. Sure, the romance could be soppy at times, but this doesn\\'t deny the fact that this movie is a masterpiece. Never have I seen a film with so much vigour and passion, entirely devoting itself to the horrors of that one tragic night. The movie is an experience rather than a viewing ; You get so involved with this isolated society at sea, as well as the characters, relationships and barbarity they experience. Firstly, it\\'s worth praising the astounding set production, design and costumes. These all helped give us a beautiful, classic image of people at the time, as well as the splendour of the Titanic. The movie makes full use of its editing and cinematography to help convey the story in a more personal way. Every emotion the characters experience, we experience too, and this is largely thanks to the filmography. For example, the last half of the movie when the Titanic is sinking, utilises effective editing and videography, from its suspenseful action shots to the more sombre and touching scenes. The performances were mostly good. Unfortunately sometimes I did find Kate Winslet\\'s acting slightly annoying and over melodramatic, although the screenplay could be widely to blame. Leo was impeccable with his cheeky demeanour and charming looks. It\\'s to be said that Leo and Kate have captivating chemistry throughout, and I have no distaste in saying this is one of the greatest love stories ever told. The movie had set up Jacks and Rose\\'s romance so well in the first half, and we had become so attached to their story, that by the second half we are completely glued to our seats and praying for the survival of the two main leads. In this sense the movie is very clever in sucking us into the relationship between these two characters. I loved the movies strong focus on the different treatment of the upper and lower classes, whilst exposing the egotistical and narcissistic nature of rich men like Cal, thus commentating on the unfairness of social class. His character was very well written, as he comes across as incredibly intimidating and possessive throughout *shivers*. It amazes me how a movie based on the Titanic has come to create a entirely different story of its own. The last half of the movie is what truly makes this a masterpiece. The sinking is told in great detail from beginning to end, portraying the slow descent into chaos and death. The atmosphere was filled with tragedy and sorrow, and never faltered in keeping us gripped the entire time. The mixture of sadness, despair and loss of life makes this an incredibly powerful yet disastrous look at the sinking of the Titanic. This movie succeeds because of the profound and overwhelming mixture of emotions we experience. We laugh, we despair, we swoon, we cry ; The movie transports us right into the action as if we were there. Overall, although this movie has problems, I can\\'t deny that this is a staple in global cinema and is extremely enjoyable. I will never forget my first time watching it, as it was the first time I had ever felt so strongly about a film. It would be rude for me to rate it lower than a ten. Highly recommend! Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron\\'s ego. Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made. Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn\\'t really too wonderful. Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I\\'ve ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning. I didn\\'t understand Billy Zane\\'s character, but he wasn\\'t on very much, so I didn\\'t have to be confused by him a lot. I do think it\\'s awful that all those girls cried only over \"Leo\" and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion. The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn\\'t spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances. Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she\\'s given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else. Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well. Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good. Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there\\'s enough there to really affect you. Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene. And just tell me you weren\\'t in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on. I mean, come on! This really happened! It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under. All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn\\'t up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there. Perhas if people just didn\\'t look at the first part and only at the second part, they\\'d understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again. Maybe it doesn\\'t deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says. Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn\\'t? There\\'s more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look. nan James Cameron is one of my favorite filmmakers,but I loathe TITANIC. Of course,how can I argue with all the teenyboppers who turned it into a hit? This movie is worthless,albeit beautiful. It\\'s just so incredibly precalculated and manipulative and annoying. I forget what prompted me to see Titanic for the first time -- I think it was a comment I read in an article by a Japanese man who said he was moved by the bravery of the men putting wives and children aboard lifeboats and telling gallant lies to comfort the little ones.\\n\\nSee it I did, however, and I was so visually stunned I entirely missed how lousy the movie was.\\n\\nI went to see it a second time because my son had been reading about the Titanic and wanted to see how the sinking was depicted. This time I noticed how lame the characters and plot were.\\n\\nI went to see it a third time because a friend of mine who doesn\\'t have a car asked me to bring him and offered to treat me and my kids to popcorn and sodas, and pay for our tickets, if I\\'d take him. That last time I left the theater absolutely outraged.\\n\\nTitanic is a sorry example of the moral decay of western civilization. Characters we were supposed to sympathize with were elbowing women and children out of their way to save their own miserable skins. Instead of reaching out to help the woman clutching a baby, Kate and Leo reminisce about the night they met. Leonardo hefts the worthless and shallow Kate onto the floating door to save her life, when he could have saved a dozen innocent children instead. Titanic was a monumental ego-trip and monument to selfishness. The only sympathetic characters were the designer, the captain, and the Irish widow with the two small children. I could smack Cameron in frustration -- imagine what a wonderful plot he could have built around this woman and Kate\\'s shallow character! Picture it -- the widow flees Ireland to join her brother in America after the town rich creep offers to save her from poverty at the expense of her virtue. The widow sees Kate on the railing and gives her a picture of what suffering really is. Take it from there -- it can go in any number of directions far more interesting than the cookie-cutter lust story. Pathetic.\\n\\nAs I told my kids on the drive home from the theater, \"If you every survive a shipwreck by ignoring the cries of drowning children, don\\'t bother coming home.\" I remember when I watched `Titanic\\' back 1n 1997/1998, I had watch it for about 6 or 5 times in the theater. And it\\'s not just me because everybody does! Being the holder of the world record for the most successful film ever made and winning 11 Oscar, crafted it became a true classic. No one will ever forget easily to Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater three days romance that ended with tragedy.\\n\\nEven tough many critics said that `Titanic\\' was nothing except a piece of shallowly and clichÃ© crab, but James Cameron proves that he could manage a wonderful tale of love and one of the most disastrous event that ever happen became one in a magnificent visualization story telling.\\n\\nThe chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is so strong like they are really meant to be lover. The romance is thrilling, the action is heart-pounding and the F/X is first class. I barely can find any flaws on it.\\n\\n10/10 Epic Powerhouse!\\n\\nGlorious Filmmaking, with a Great Cast and Directed Masterfully with a Level of Production Value rarely equalled.\\n\\nAdded to the Biggest Disaster at Sea, a Fictional Romance to bring a Human Dimension to this Legendary Tragedy.\\n\\nSimply Brilliant! I am simply amazed that such a popular, beloved, critically and audience acclaimed film favorite as \"Titanic\" could sink so unseemly in the minds of so many who shelled out heavy sums of money and lauded it heavily at the time of its tremendous popularity. While \"Titanic\" is hardly as fresh, riveting, and entertaining as it was when I first viewed it several years ago, it still certainly retains a special distinction in the realm of cinema, at least in my assessment. Perhaps the screenplay is overly blase, full of clichÃ©s, and historical blunders, and the spectacle and sheer horror of seeing hundreds plummet to the bottom of the Atlantic is not as harrowing as it seemed in theaters, yet \"Titanic\" is still a fine, worthy, and sensational cinematic triumph. \"Titanic\"\\'s technical aspects: its impeccable mix of sound and visual effects, dramatic and potent musical score (detract the obsolete \"My Heart Will Go On\"), ingenious costume design, absorbing cinematography, and of course the gorgeous, stupendous design of the ship, still stand well above many efforts in cinematic history today, and are plenty appreciated and admired. The romance between Rose and Jack is perhaps the most clichÃ© and nauseating aspect of the film, which, despite the film\\'s perception as being \"extremely overrated\" might be \"Titanic\"\\'s primary detractor, and that would be fully understandable- if these same critics weren\\'t the ones who rushed to the cinemas to embrace the romance in the film! Overall, \"Titanic\" is a leviathon of a film: boasting popularity and critical acclaim and some really brilliant cinematic aspects, where it somewhat lacks in the script and the romance. I have probably viewed \"Titanic\" over 100 times, and though its value and enticement has been compromised through numerous viewings, it still retains a laudable, important distinction as providing both rock-solid entertainment and brilliant cinematic quality, and these features are too complimentary for such a film as \"Titanic\" to sink through history. ***1/2 out of **** It\\'s just stupid that says this movie is bad. Titanic is one of the best films ever made, not even today there is anyone who dares to make a remake because everyone knows that there will never be a film about Titanic better than this one. James Cameron really knows how to tell a story and make an amazing movie.\\n\\nThis film holds up brilliantly 15 years after its initial release. The new 3-D version is fantastic - especially the shots of the ship. The underwater scenes are stunning. It is all done masterfully.\\n\\nHow they go back and remake a live action film into 3-D is a mystery to me but the magic works.\\n\\nIn recent years, I choose to see most films on DVD or Blu-Ray, but this one was worth a trip to the theater. I never left my seat once.\\n\\nSeeing the film again since the real life passing of Gloria Stuart (old Rose) and seeing it on the 100th anniversary of Titanic\\'s one and only sailing made it that much more poignant. nan OK, the biggest film of all time. Let us remember that it was good. It looks astounding, even now. It takes the already good A Night To Remember and improves upon it. The much-derided love story works for me, I\\'m sorry. In fact, the one bad thing anyone had to say about this in 1997 was that the dialogue wasn\\'t up to scratch. Excuse me? How many quotable lines? `She\\'s made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can sink.\\' `I\\'m the king of the world!\\' `We are dressed in our best and prepared to go down as gentlemen. But we would like a brandy.\\' `You unimaginable bastard!\\' This film is a true classic in the old-fashioned sense of the word. There are three stories here, all very well written and produced. We all know the basic story of the ship the Titanic, but Cameron\\'s depiction of the actual events is so much better than any written account.\\n\\nWe see the captain, we see the doubts as he weighs up the pressures he is under from the ship owners, and the publicity people. Then, later, he has to face the reality that his ship is going to sink and he is probably going to die, probably unpleasantly. And we see the ship\\'s designer and builder. We see the officers and the crew and all the problems they face and how they react. Sometimes well, sometimes not. We see the wealthy first-class passengers and their life of luxury, now they face death and can\\'t do anything about it.\\n\\nThe production of all these events is impressive, walls bursting, floods of water, people sliding down the tilted deck, falling off. Then we see the horrible sight of the lifeboats as they search for anyone still living in the freezing water. So graphic, as is the first scenes of the modern attempt to recover items from the wreck, especially the way they explain to Rose what physically happened. Clever.\\n\\nI suppose most viewers will concentrate on the story of Jack (Dicaprio) and Rose (Winslet). But this part, although very well done, is quite ordinary, just another love/lust story. He saves her life, she saves his later. Not many standout scenes or dialogue for either of them.\\n\\nThe third part of the story is Rose, 84 years later. The casting by Mali Finn is great. Gloria Stuart is a recognizable older version of Rose and including her joins many of the events throughout the film. Very clever, well done Mr Cameron. It is quite easy to be swept away by Titanic\\'s outstanding cinematography or exceptional musical score, and as a result a lot of its obvious flaws and faults seem to be overlooked. As an objective viewer however it is quite obviously an unfortunate disappointment.\\n\\nAs stated before the cinematography in Titanic is fantastic, with a lot of widescreen shots of the ship from high angles. A couple of scenes such as the attempted Rose suicide near its start or when the final part of the ship goes down do look pretty bad and fake though, but for most of the film it looks pretty beautiful. The indoor set design is also amazing, and it basically breathes 1912 to look at its elegant and artistic design. The musical score by James Horner is also ( as to be expected from him ) a beautiful emotional piece that seems to fit extremely well in Titanic. However, while it is a very stylish film this way, it doesn\\'t manage to be impressive on the actual substantial aspects of cinema, such as its acting or its screenplay, which are both very inconsistent to say the least. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates & Bernard Hill are some examples of actors/actress who do show a impressive performance, but Kate Winslet as young Rose has this monotone emotionless look on her face all the time, and i find it hard to see what Jack ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) sees in her because of this. Winslet is not capable of acquiring the emotional intensity that is required for a role such as this, since her acting is so theatrical and not very natural. While DiCaprio is a fantastic actor, he seems to be struggling in every scene in Titanic, primarily because he is simply miscast. He is not the type of actor for a supposed heart tugging romance, and he is thus unable to truly capture the essence of their bond. ( For an actually GOOD young DiCaprio role, watch the Basketball Diaries (1995) )\\n\\nUnfortunately James Cameron not only wanted to direct, but also write a film as grand in scale as this one. This results in a pretty mediocre screenplay and dialogue that a kid could have come up with. Titanic offers little sub text, symbolism or depth since its writing is sub par to say the least. There are a lot of corny moments and clichÃ© dialogue ( The entire scene of Rose discovering Jack\\'s talent for drawings for example ) and all the while it has very little subtlety and it is unable to tell the audience something without blatantly having some character saying it, which in itself is ofcourse an insult to the audience\\'s intelligence, and it results in Titanic being quite a poorly written movie that is not intelligent and most of the time just plain dumb.\\n\\nThe first part of the film seems more like a social commentary instead of a film, as Cameron tries his best to show the audience what a bunch of snobbish unlikeable & arrogant folk the rich people are, and how outgoing and free the poor people seem to be. This might not have been so bad, if Cameron actually managed to be subtle in this matter, but this was not the case, as for example Billy Zane\\'s character Cal is such an unsubtle way of telling the audience that the rich are bad. Ofcourse no offense to Billy Zane, who was great as his character, but his entire character is utterly ridiculous and he is unable to perform a single likeable action throughout the entire film, and this never changes. We get it Cameron, the rich guy is the bad guy, no need to shove it down our throats. Cameron\\'s greatest mistake seems to be the decision to write the movie himself instead of bringing in an experienced screenplay writer.\\n\\nThe second half of the film is more of a disaster movie, and it isn\\'t so different from your average modern day monster blockbuster, except the monster in this film is the water. Even if there were any hidden meaning behind the first half of Titanic, the second half contains no depth whatsoever, and shows us the demise of a lot of characters nobody knows and nobody cares about. In the end we don\\'t really care that much about Rose and Jack either, since their acting was not up to the challenge and the dialogue provided by Cameron was not fantastic either. It also shows us multiple instances of weird moments of self sacrifice, with people sacrificing themselves for no obvious reason instead of trying to escape. While this might be realistic in a film about the Japanese bushido code, in Titanic it feels out of character and it just doesn\\'t fit, since these are all normal people who should want to simply get on with their lives.\\n\\nCameron might show some images to impress the audience with his take on this real life tragedy, ( The opening scene with the old footage of Titanic actually setting off with Horner\\'s score is ofcourse fantastic ) but in substance Titanic is severely flawed and the experience of watching it is therefore less immersive which in turn makes it lack the emotional impact it should have had. Because IMDb has too many fanboys who think Batman should be the top rated film of all-time, movies like Titantic will never succeed here. Great storytelling, a historical background, good acting, excellent directing, great special effects and a beautiful soundtrack.. Titantic won all those Oscars and is the highest grossing film of all-time. I don\\'t think anyone involved with it will lose any sleep on how it\\'s rated at this site. I loved it when it came out and still watch it a lot.. It\\'s the type of film that makes being a movie fan a joy. It\\'s film making at it\\'s best and no moron trying to put it down will ever change that. nan nan We all know what the film is based of off, and we expected that. But what I\\'m sure that audiences didn\\'t expect was a plot as deep as it gets. With an amazing and large cast, Titanic offers more teardrops then a funeral. One thing that stands out over everything else is the fantastic musical score by James Horner and Celine Deon. Possibly the best since Hans Zimmer in the Lion King in 1994. Titanic released in 1997 changed cinema as we know it. Offering a deep, and emotional story with performance you will enjoy with your eyes, and music that you will be humming for years to come. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, and Kathy Bates are amongst one of the largest cast in film history (up to that point). It is a film you will have to see to not only believe, but enjoy as well. This is James Cameron\\'s Titanic. I have grown quite sick of this movie and the Celiene Deon song. If there wasn\\'t some much said about it, I probably would have liked it more. Frankly, the dialogue and much of the plot was silly. The way they told the story, by starting in the present, was quite interesting, and compared to other disaster films its outstanding, but best movie of all time? NO! So many romance movies come out these days, and so many of them have characters, stories, and relationships that are hopelessly difficult to care about. Who could have guessed that James Cameron, known for highly visual works like Terminator and Aliens, would create what is in my mind unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever? If I had gone into Titanic blind, I certainly wouldn\\'t have. I will get the few real flaws out of the way first. Leonardo DiCaprio, as great as he is in this film, is forced to yell commands to Rose a bit too much. And the 3D is a gimmick, nothing more. However, to my knowledge, this is the only way to experience this film in IMAX, so for me at least, wearing the glasses was well worth it. Though I\\'m sure I am overlooking some, that\\'s about it for the bad. On to the good. Firstly, I hope that the rerelease of this acclaimed film will remind directors of romantically-minded movies everywhere of how to do it right. James Cameron starts the film in the present day (or at least, it was when it was released), with an expedition to the titular wreck overseen by an enthusiastic explorer (Bill Paxton). He finds a bunch of papers in a safe on the ship, and restores a drawing of a young woman naked, wearing only a necklace. This sets into motion a series of events leading to a three hour long flashback detailing Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet, played in the \"present\" by Gloria Stuart), and her passionate relationship with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). I could type for hours about how well-acted, emotional, and real this pair seems. I won\\'t, but suffice it to say that all acting awards were well-deserved. For the bare majority of the film, Jack and Rose are in the spotlight. The length of the film actually works to its advantage, because ample time is given to see how their relationship springs, wilts, and ultimately blossoms. Jack is a lower-class man, and even he makes no bones about it. Rose is from the opposite end of the spectrum, and hates it. Jack finds he about to commit suicide over her marriage forced on her by her mother. The moments the two share really sell their relationship, enough so that the audience becomes invested as well. Class differences are an extremely prominent issue, brought up again and again. At one point, Rose reminds a frantic crewman that only half the ship\\'s population can fit on the lifeboats. Her husband-to-be overhears this, and replies \"the better half.\" The rich are not painted in a sympathetic light. They are arrogant, selfish, and terrible people that throw others off just to have themselves a little more space. Cameron goes this extra mile to ensure that we are sympathetic with Rose. She is forced to walk among these horrid humans, and finally, stumbles upon someone that treats her as an equal, and in an almost husband-like manner, as opposed to her stuck-up, borderline misogynistic fiancee. After almost two hours of engaging, superb relationship-building, the inevitable iceberg looms. This, of course, is where James Cameron\\'s signature technical brilliance kicks in in full force. Metal is torn asunder, flooding commences everywhere, and there are many grand exterior shots showing the Titanic going down. All of which are done with excellent special effects that look as real as any of the characters in the midst of them. This is also where the movie becomes incredibly, brutally honest about what probably happened once the ship began to sink. Hundreds are shown drowning and falling, including children. The rich shun the poor, literally kicking them off lifeboats. SOS signals are sent, and fireworks are launched. And, in what could be the greatest scene in the film, four string instrument players lament the catastrophe the only way they know how. And through it all, Rose and Jack find each other through the worst of it, and stay alive until the last possible moment. James Cameron\\'s work in this film is truly extraordinary. He is not known for crafting compelling characters or stories. However, in these respects, he succeeds brilliantly here. In modern romance films, characters and their tribulations are about as genuine as cardboard cutouts. Cameron has created a set, populated it with characters that fill it to the last inch, and bound it all together with great attention to artistic and technical detail. I left trying to sort out what I liked most about it. I haven\\'t yet decided, but I knew then and know now that I have seen a beautiful masterpiece from the unlikeliest of sources. oh my god this movie is awful i hate this movie one of the worst movies what the world has ever produced and of course the worst soundtrack ever \"my heart will go on\" Celine Dion big crap. it must be a epic but it\\'s a piece of crap.Titanic,the ship of dreams i say titanic the ship of crap.i don\\'t i hate people who dead in 1912.but titanic is crap.it\\'s silly and overrated.i don\\'t understand why this crap won 11 Oscars why?it\\'s so boring movie.i didn\\'t even liked the acting it was too hammy.James Cameron is not bad director,but this is black piece to his movies.so i don\\'t recommend it to anyone.watch something else.maybe a lot of people love this movie but i hate this movie. 1.5/10 If \"Gone With the Wind\" could be said to define the movie epic in the first half of the 20th century, than \"Titanic\" can certainly be said to define it for the second half. Both films are set against significant moments in history, both have spectacular special effects, both have love story subplots. But, most importantly, both have heart and a real respect for their audience, something you seldom see any more. Certainly no film since \"GWTW\" has had this much publicity blitz. And no film INCLUDING \"GWTW\" has had as large an audience at its opening. Even though you\\'ve probably seen both films several times, if you\\'re like me, you\\'ll never tire of seeing them again. And that\\'s the mark of a true classic. The special effects of this film are some of the best I have seen in a movie. The great Titanic slipping under the waves, the people staying aboard for as long as they can, the individual stories of the famous people that were really on the ship (Molly Brown for example), The Capitans refusal to slow the ship down due to iceberg warnings and so on. Most of us know the story of the great liner that sank on that cold April night. Taken as that alone James Cameron\\'s film is a masterpiece. You really feel like you are on the real Titanic with the people of the time. The problem I have with this film is Leonardo DiCaprio. Say what you want but I feel he was mis-cast. He does not even try to act in a way you would expect a man of 1912 to act with his squeaky voice, saying things like horse-^*@% and I know how the world works. In other words he acts like he just came from a day at the beach. Kate Winslet is better in her role as Rose Bukater but I would have preferred a different actress. She plays the part mostly as someone who needs to grow up. The love affair between the two main characters is not believable and serves only as a distraction. Granted just showing the history of the famous ship with the people who were really there would have been boring for most young viewers without some modern story they could relate to. In this case a cheesy love story. Aside from that this film pretty much works. I watched it for the story of the Titanic and the actions of the crew that night, and the mistakes that were made that lead up to the disaster. Cameron crafted this part of the film so you felt that you were really there. Jack Dawson and Rose Bukater seemed out of place.... Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event.\\n\\nFrom the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie.\\n\\nI was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see. While I still feel that Cameron\\'s Titanic lacks the emotional impact of \\'A Night to Remember\\' it still packs a relative wallop. I will not be jumping on the trendy \\'let\\'s bash Titanic, because chicks like it\\' bandwagon, because when I went to see the film in the theater I was blown away. The emotional impact alone of the ship sinking made this film worthwhile. I was moved and the real tragedy of the event was brought home directly. Now, on videotape, this is not anywhere near as grand, but it is still quite decent.\\n\\nThe love story was not really anywhere near as bad as people say, I think that both Winslet and Dicaprio have done decent films and will continue to do decent films. In retrospect, I am sure that Titanic will not be remembered as their best film, but it will probably be their most remembered. I was less touched by the romance than I was by the sense of history (small \\'h\\' history) that the framing of the story provided. It was a nice love story, not a particularly great one, but a nice one. However, the scene at the end, when Rose goes back into the ship and meets Jack, still young and handsome, is a nice touch and a moving vignette.\\n\\nWhile I will not claim Titanic to a brilliant film, or a deep film, it was a beautiful film and I still enjoy watching it. James Cameron\\'s blockbuster Titanic is timeless, moving, and a real visual splendor (though they could brush up on one or two CGI scenes). The attention to detail is stunning and breathtaking. It is perfectly written and perfectly cast - particularly with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They both are extremely talented, top-notch actors. You don\\'t even notice how long it goes for. It grabs you and sucks you in. But it is also sad and a bit depressing knowing what will happen at the end. I haven\\'t cried at a movie in a long time, so was surprised to find myself crying at this movie. I can relate in some respects to Rose and I really like the message about enjoying life. A strongly recommended movie. There isn\\'t much to say about this film other than incredible. A true epic masterpiece. I admit to seeing it five time in the theater an countless times since then. Once you\\'ve seen the film the first time, it\\'s opening scene and music immediately drives you to tears and they don\\'t really stop for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes. As clichÃ©d as the story of jack and Rose may be, a name had to be given to the faces that we lost in this preventable tragedy. And what a powerful love story it is. To have loved so deeply and passionately in such short a time and have it stay with you forever is what everyone wishes for themselves. A lot of flack is given to Cameron\\'s script, and while it could be have been better, it certainly wasn\\'t laughable. Winslet and DiCaprio gave incredible performances with what they were given and this film will truly stand the test of time, due to its powerful gritty nature. It was almost better back in the day when it was split up into two tapes and I would never put the 2nd one in because it was too heartbreaking to sit through. This film is truly a masterpiece. I\\'ve seen it a dozen time and ugly cry every time. So many things have been said and written about the movie \"Titanic\". And well before it premiered in theaters around the globe. After all, it\\'s not everyday that the most-expensive movie of all time is released and it was James Cameron\\'s first theatrical release since \"True Lies\" in 1994, three years before \"Titanic\".\\n\\nSince its release in December 1997, \"Titanic\" still is a talking subject. Not necessarily in family reunions, but in film, it\\'s an unmissable. Not only it was the most expensive movie ever made, it also became the most successful and that title still remains up to that date.\\n\\nThe storyline is very simple and doesn\\'t break any serious ground, but every guy who only has a small knowledge in cinema knows that story by heart and even the main characters\\' names.\\n\\nThe story begins in present day, where a group of researchers led by Brock Lovett (played by Bill Paxton) explore the Titanic\\'s wreck and discover the portrait of a nude young woman wearing a huge necklace. When she learns of that discovery by the means of her granddaughter\\'s TV, an old woman named Rose reveals to Mr. Lovett that the lady in the portrait is none other than herself.\\n\\nOld Rose is brought to Lovett\\'s ship and tells the story of what happened in early April 1912. Young Rose (Kate Winslet) is a late teenager from a wealthy family and she is engaged with Cal (Billy Zane), the heir of a big fortune. However, Rose doesn\\'t love neither Cal, nor her very reclusive lifestyle and dreams of freedom.\\n\\nShe\\'s planning to suicide until she meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), an American street rat who makes portraits of nude women and sells them for living.\\n\\nThis is the typical premise for a romantic story: the two less-likely people who could get together meet themselves. They are in a two-class difference (Rose 1st and Jack 3rd) and, at first, they don\\'t fit much each other. But the more they pass time together, the more they realize that they\\'re made to be together.\\n\\nThe first problems for that couple is evidently the fish-out-of-water situations. Jack is a poor guy who temporarily finds himself in the high society of the time and Rose, who voluntarily wants to get out of water, spends time with Jack with the other 3rd class passengers whose lifestyle is very different from the 1st class one.\\n\\nBut the biggest problem happens next. Because when you say \\'Titanic\\', the first thing that should go to your mind is \\'iceberg\\'. This is where the special effects wizards enter into action. And it\\'s at that moment that you see why this movie cost more than what a third-world country has for all of its people.\\n\\nThe sinking is the best part of the movie. It\\'s more thrilling, more exciting and more visually-dazzling than the best action blockbusters made by Jerry Bruckheimer or the like. The spectacular views of people falling from the top of the ship, the blowing furniture, the water infiltrations, the frozen bodies floating on the ocean... All of that stuff earns my best regards.\\n\\nThe movie is also an epic because of its representation of the early 20th century society. During all of the movie, there\\'s one thing that\\'s never in doubt: it IS 1912. The high society is well shown by the 1st class cabins, the costumes, the ballroom, the majordomos and the like. That kind of stuff could easily be grabbed by an history teacher to show how life was in 1912.\\n\\nIt\\'s just impossible to hate \"Titanic\". Simply because there\\'s something for everyone. Those who love romantic stories will definitely fall for the Jack-Rose relationship. This is strongly due to the actors\\' performances. It is not DiCaprio or Winslet\\'s first acting roles, but that kind of hyper-budgeted movie is what was needed to show their talent to the world. And they don\\'t waste their time. DiCaprio is charming (tell that to young girls) and professional, while Winslet delivers the greatest acting performance of all.\\n\\nBut one actor that is often forgotten is Billy Zane. His interpretation of Cal is very strong and has unfairly been locked in the closet. He\\'s very aggressive, tyrannic and egotistical. That\\'s exactly what\\'s needed for the third side of the love triangle.\\n\\nThose who prefer spectacle will have to wait until the middle of the movie to see the Titanic\\'s sinking but it\\'s worth waiting. It\\'s time that you don\\'t see passing.\\n\\nThose who like history will definitely be pleased by the movie\\'s sets. It\\'s like a travel in the past. Cameron used to be a science-fiction specialist but he works astonishingly well in any time period.\\n\\nEverybody should approach \"Titanic\" like if they know nothing about it. Because I did and I\\'m glad I did. I know some people who can\\'t stand such mass publicity made about a guy with an Italian-sounding name and the mass budget allowed for that movie. But if you defer your judgment for a moment, you\\'ll see that \"Titanic\" is one of the finest movies of the decade and the greatest disaster film of all time. Because there\\'s nothing more stupendous that a catastrophe that really happened. I have always been fascinated by the story of the Titanic, and I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, what I got was a cold, mindless Hollywood romance flick that merely used the Titanic as a springboard to emptier things.\\n\\nI found it less than moving. The romantic storyline was nothing new at all, and the acting and dialogue was generally laughable. What did work? It has lots of pretty faces, elaborate set-design and special effects, plus looks and feels \\'epic\\' (with no substance to back it up).\\n\\nJust a big, empty romance-disaster movie here. If your interested in the story of the Titanic, read about it in books, there is little here we don\\'t already know and the focus is mainly on the characters, who are no more than one-dimensional stereotypes. I\\'ve noticed recently how various critics and the general population treat Titanic horribly with the test of time. I find it shocking how a movie that was regarded as one of the best movies of all time has fallen ill to tons of criticisms. People seem to find it hip now days to bash Titanic and I fail to understand why. I personally find it to be the greatest movie I\\'ve seen, the Academy Awards seemed to think it was a pretty damn good movie, the critics when it first came out weren\\'t too harsh and movie-goer\\'s truly expressed how the general population felt about Titanic with the gigantic ticket sales.\\n\\nNow, however, Titanic makes the \"overblown movie\" lists from several critics, endures extreme mockery and the ridicule of anyone who actually admits to liking it. This may have been due to people wanting to be different from the norm in 1997 and maybe this attitude never went away and too many people fell victim to it. Or maybe it was the cheesy scene\\'s people like to imitate over and over which obviously must mean the entire movie is cheesy. However, I recently watched Titanic the other day and I\\'m going to say why I find it to my favorite movie of all time.\\n\\nThe ship Titanic itself expressed a mentality during this time period in which humans felt they could overcome Mother Nature. With the sinking of this ship it made people truly eat the words \"Titanic is an unsinkable ship.\"\\n\\nWith the character Rose, a first class passenger you are exposed to the arrogance high society had. Rose also opened your eyes to the luxuries high society had and how woman were truly trapped and were seen as second-class citizens. Rose almost committing suicide helps hit home how truly horrible it must have been for woman during this time period. The dynamics between Rose and her mother also show the dynamics between how woman had to behave and in a sense how they survived in this society.\\n\\nWith the character Jack, a third class passenger you are exposed to how large the gab between the rich and poor was. How first class dogs went down to be walked on the lower decks, how it was the poor who actually built Titanic and how it was the poor who were treated truly unfair on Titanic just because of social status, which helped express the mentality of the time.\\n\\nHaving these two characters meet and expose the viewer and each other to these different lifestyles helped truly put into perspective the mentality of what this time period was like. Sure, it was in a way a clichÃ©\\x1ae love story, two people from different world\\'s falling in love. But regardless of it being typical it still exposed the different classes in a way that truly made you realize how it was for people back then. Also, many things are clichÃ©\\x1a\\' for a reason, they most of the time work and have been shown to work time and time again.\\n\\nWithout this love story you would have just come away with the basics of this story, the Titanic sinking. But this love story created sympathy in which you felt for Jack and Rose. It made you truly feel how the people on the Titanic were feeling at that exact moment. Families, loved ones and friends were being torn apart. Without the emotion created from the love story you wouldn\\'t have felt nearly as sad or seriously towards what had actually happened to these people.\\n\\nAs for it being morally wrong on the part of Rose. Well, she was trapped by her mother and society. The man (Cal) whom she was getting married to proved to be inconsiderate towards others, was very mean, rude and thoughtless (even before he knew of the situation between Rose and Jack). He deserved and was asking for everything he got. What Rose did was what many do in youth and sometimes you have to take what life gives you at that moment. That\\'s exactly what she did and people shouldn\\'t say her actions were immoral. They were done out of love at first sight and out of vengeance towards the arrogant class she was apart of.\\n\\nTitanic was very authentic and very historically accurate. It did include a lot more then just the love story. It had information about the lifeboats, the binoculars, how exactly it sank, the famous people aboard the ship, and numerous other things. Even things such as the first-class band and their situation, what exactly was sung on the last time day light hit the Titanic at the morning church gathering, increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings and many more examples were all little details included in this movie which made it far more then just a \"love story\" if you actually paid attention.\\n\\nOne of the major flaws people say this movie had was the acting. I however thought it had amazing acting and I saw nothing wrong with it. Acting is something that is hard to pin-point in terms of being good or bad. I find it an easy way to attack any film. If you say the acting is bad, you cannot really \"prove\" to that person it was good. Acting is something that just goes to personal opinion and you cannot really change someone\\'s mind on it. I personally give an A+ for acting and even the script. But one thing to consider is that many shots could only be done a few times or even once because of what they had to do to the sets, making it sometimes hard to get the perfect take.\\n\\nOverall, one the best movies ever made. This movie is complete rubbish. It is two hours too long and it has terrible acting in it. The ship was the only thing really impressive and Kate winsletts boobs. But Leonardo Dicaprio was totally miscasted for the movie. The love story is pathetic. The sinking of the boat is also quite impressive. But Pearl Harbor has much better effects than this. This movie stole a whole bunch of academy awards. James Cameron really knows how to put on a show. T-2, The Abyss, True Lies and Aliens, all of his films have been hugely enjoyable, rich in epic scope and emotional flavor. Whether it be science fiction or in this case an historical disaster film, he really knows how to create rich epic entertainment and with Titanic he has probably made his finest film artistically. Sure, there are many who don\\'t like the film , historians will go \\'tut-tut\\' which they always do anyway at any film based on historical fact, but Cameron makes his interpretation of the Titanic disaster work so well, mainly because he knows how to tell a story really well and he is a master at creating suspense in his action sequences.\\n\\nThe first half of Titanic in undeniably moving. The love story between Jack and Rose may have every cliche in the book (the jealous fiance, the evil mother in law, the tug of love between lover and family) but let me tell you Cameron can make these cliches really work here. The epic scale puts it above sheer soap opera and with fantastic performances from Winslet, Zane and even DiCaprio, Cameron really makes the love story work from a story telling point of view and a visual one. The way he presents the first kiss on the bow, to the drawing of a nude rose through to the love scene, Cameron makes his finest film, and if this were just a period love piece it would be enough, but as this is about the sinking of the Titanic he has more aces up his sleeve and he creates the most moving motion picture in many a decade. Not since the days of David Lean has a love story been presented in such a way, and when that iceberg comes, Cameron mixes love story and historical disaster in the most fantastic way which ensured that audiences responded in their droves.\\n\\nSure this is not great art, it is a Hollywood blockbuster, one, like Gladiator (it too a fantastic film) that takes the audience back to the good old days when big budgeted blockbusters had a great plot as well as superb special effects, and with Cameron at the helm we are getting the best of both worlds. All of this culminates in some of the most moving scenes in a mainstream Hollywood film I have ever seen. They are not manipulative. They are well written.\\n\\nThis is a superb film on every level. Well done James, you have done it again. This movie was awesome. This movie begins as people were hoping to go to America to be U.S. citizens and were boarding on the biggest cruise liner that would take them to America. Titanic was known as the ship that would would never have the problem that developed along the way to America. This starts as Leonardo DeCapro(Jack Dawson) makes his way on the ship by a lucky business. Everything starts off well on the ship but when Jack falls in love with Rose things did not start off right because Rose\\'s parents were favorable about them seeing each other. Rose\\'s fiancÃ© tries to make things very complicated for Jack but Jack keeps trying. A few weeks into the cruise the liner develops that horrible nobody can imagine. While trying to make it safe off the ship Rose\\'s fiancÃ© tries everything to stop them from getting off the ship together. I enjoyed seeing this movie. To see if Jack and Rose make it safety stay tuned. nan I know this is the best (overrated) movie of all, so I watched this film...it earn its place as the best movie of all time. The visual surprising still holds up for a movie that came out 2 decades ago, the music score is the best thing I ever heard, the cinematography is beautifully shot, and the tone of the movie is very lovable and emotional. Watching this for first time is such a blast, but sadly, I won\\'t have that same feeling again if I go watch it again. This movie is very memorable for generations to come. Sure, the script was undistinguished. If it were not, this would be one of the true great movies of all time. As it is, the visual beauty of the movie, the wonderful score, the fine acting, and the very nature of the tragedy made this an unforgettable movie for me. Movies rarely can rise above a less than great script; the genius of Cameron is that in this case, he was able to do it. I am amazed that anyone could be so unemotional as to not cry as the end of this movie. While on my first viewing, I was indeed a little dismayed that this was not another \"Night to Remeber\", all this was forgotten on my second viewing as I got swept away by it all. And I can\\'t imagine what other movie from the Best Picture nominees should have won over Titianic. Certinaly not the very overrated and dull LA Confidential, or the annoying and maudlin \"Good Will Hunting\", or the charming, but lightweight \"Full Monty.\" Titanic got every award it deserved, and did not get the ones it didn\\'t. 9 out of 10. I kept putting off seeing this movie with my wife because I labeled it a chick movie,I was so very wrong, Titanic has well written characters and a story even though we knew the ending keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire three hours. There really was a Rose on the Titanic. The critics of this movie only have to look at the fact that is made almost 2 billion dollars world wide when no movie have ever made more than 900 million,this Titanic amount of cannot be just from teenage girls. Titanic is as close to a perfect movie as has ever been made. I give it a 10 and put it in my top 20 with the likes of the Godfather and jaws. nan some movies don\\'t live up to their hype, some don\\'t even live up to be movies. But this; this one does that and so much more. James Cameron\\'s Titanic tells the story of Jack Dawson a poor and down on his luck painter who scores tickets for passage on the \"Unsinkable\" Titanic, there he meets Rose Dewitt Bukator. Rose is traveling to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob of a fiancÃ©e Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley, and on the way the two become fast friends and soon fall in love. For those of you who have heard the story or haven\\'t heard of it at all this is the movie to watch. All be it it\\'s not a hundred percent accurate but it does well with telling the tragic story of the titanic. The Titanic is a monumental achievement of film making at it\\'s best and also one of the highest grossing film\\'s of all time, It\\'s a beautiful film with great heart and soul; you feel every emotion that\\'s in the film love, joy, angry, sorrow ,fear and anguish. Titanic is a romantic film that no other in the genre can follow or surpass, it\\'s an amazing love story and tear jerker all rolled up into one. James Cameron creates a beautiful and breathtaking scenery and magnificent special effects in a film to end all film\\'s. Titanic is one of the greatest film\\'s ever made and will continue to inspire people to believe in fate, and in love. nan I have resisted seeing this movie for a long time. After all the ship sinks and given that they produce a survivor to tell the story I had a funny feeling that she too would survive. The whole where is the treasure thing was unneeded. The movie would have been better not as her story (which it could not have been since it continuously showed things about which she could not have known) but as her love story. No late twentieth century stuff just her in the end giving her name to the officer on the ship as they entered New York harbor. That would have been a perfectly acceptable end to a rather implausible love story.\\n\\nThe script is as ponderous as the movie is long. Then there is the how old are these two lover anyway factor. For DiCaprio\\'s character to have done everything he had done would have made him much older and more jaded to the ways of the world, even movie version Americans lose their innocence after a while. And the paintings that Rose collects, aside from not having been painted at the time, her tastes reflect someone beyond her 18 or so years of script time, and she quotes Freud no less.\\n\\nNever the less the actors give it their all and turn in some rather good performances. Kate Winslet and Kathy Bates being the best of the bunch and the fellow who plays Cal H. perhaps the weakest. I liked the captain and the ship\\'s architect very much, they gave convincing performances of men who have tried and recognize their failure just a bit ahead of the rest.\\n\\nQuibbles with the story are abundant. My personal one is why the lights were on as long as they were. My experience with electricity tells me that the lights would go out before the deck they are on is under water. In fact the whole ship would certainly have been much darker come final push into the water. And while we are on the subject of lights, I have seen a lot of cruise ships at night and none of them had so much light pouring out of every porthole (weren\\'t some of the folks out to dinner or, heaven forbid, in bed?\\n\\nSo the movie is too long and didn\\'t need to be by about thirty minutes just by cutting the modern day part out. It adds nothing but a phony treasure hunt. I am sick of people saying this is a bad film. Get used to it, this was a breathtaking journey, it deserved all its 11 Oscars and all its success. I am extremely surprised that it isn\\'t in the IMDb Top 250.\\n\\nI liked everything about this movie, the performances from Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates and Billy Zane were all impressive, but this time, the performances aren\\'t the sparkle in the film. It is really the effort that went into the direction, visual effects, sound and sound editing and musical score that made the film such a sparkling, memorable gem.\\n\\nThis is the best film of 1997 no doubt, and after which will soon be 4 years, I still can\\'t stop thinking about this amazing achievement.\\n\\nRating: 10 Titanic delivers,on that there is no doubt,its a supreme blockbuster,the acting is good and the script fairly good.Its the classic boy meets girl story on the doomed voyage,it has been unfairly riticised for not having a documentry approach but if you want that try the splendid A night to remember. The main characters are well developed,personally I would like a bit more sub plot,but because Rose and Jack become real people it makes the story so much more moving.The last hour is simply breathtaking and one asks the question of one self how would I behave in that situation.So watch this film in April every year and thank God you weren\\'t there. 8/10 What more could you say about Titanic? Well maybe a 100 million things more about it? When it comes to Titanic you\\'ll always think of the vision and directing of James Cameron. And even though the whole story upon the disaster isn\\'t 100% accurate I still think James was able to give a beautiful and strong directing not only the suffering and fear of the sinking but the love with Leo and Kate too. Basically Titanic is a more adventurous and maybe a little modern look on Shakespeare\\'s Romeo & Juliet. And I think it worked good to show the beauty of the ship and the love.\\n\\nThe acting is beautiful, I didn\\'t see any actors who felt forced or even ignored the ways how James wanted to do as he visioned. They take it seriously without anything that seems like they didn\\'t wanna do it. Leo gives a very good performance as the unknown boy who tries to help the desperate girl to feel more alive. In my opinion Leo does not look too boyish on this performance, no in fact he really showed to be like a man. I still enjoy his acting to this day, now when he had turned more macho than ever. Kate gives a good performance that shows the feelings from someone who\\'s rich but still there\\'s many things she can do in her life.\\n\\nThe special effects are gorgeous, they don\\'t look fake at all and even looking on Blu Ray it still looks realistic with a little improvement on certain scenes. (Don\\'t worry I don\\'t think James Cameron will be the next George Lucas because these changes are very minimal on some material that were unnecessary to have or something that was missing.)\\n\\nSure Titanic is long and does not exactly have the most original story, but everything else is just perfect for it\\'s \"recreation\" of the ship, the special effects and the acting. And yes it\\'s true that there are still many people who dislikes or even hate this movie. Many people these day\\'s seems to forget that the word \"hate\" is much harsher than \"dislike\". The movie is certainly not the world\\'s greatest film of all time.\\n\\nIs it the worst? No, but certainly very overrated and even though I have heard many of my family recommending it I wanted to take a look on the movie on my personal vision and take a calm moment and concentration if the movie really delivers. And yet it did.\\n\\nBut in case for those who are wondering I like or love many other movies than this. I understand that people who had heard from the positives that you really need to see this and the result for them they become flabbergasted or annoyed. But then, why should we always manage to see a movie that won for best picture when there are hundreds of other great movies out there. So don\\'t feel so forced about seeing Titanic, see it when you really have time to see the whole of it but ignore also those who praise it or hate it, that\\'s what I did and it felt better. nan The 1997 version of this great tragedy is a very entertaining and meticulously crafted movie. The whole plot with a romantic story makes it very likable among the youngsters, especially.\\n\\nThe detailed depiction of the interior of the liner with so many opulent and richly decorated halls and passage ways is indeed commendable. The tragic accident and events leading to capsizing of the liner with the passengers and crew caught in the iron hands of fate are all picturised with stunning craftiness.\\n\\nHowever, the cold and cruel ocean is shown too placid and calm against the backdrop of the sinking ship and floating corpses. I wonder if the open seas and oceans resemble the same. This is the only cinematic drawback which has resulted due to the filming of this top grossing movie in a swimming pool.\\n\\nFinally, the story, the whole disaster and tragedy does not cover as wide a scope and magnitude that it be crowned with eleven Oscars. The juvenile love affair between Jack and Rose does not encompass the maturity of character and therefore cannot be very engrossing or appreciative. The appeal of this movie is, although have seen more than once, the plot to chat at heart, the 3 d remakes release when everyone is looking forward to go to the, full of people, and then was shocked again.For rose and jack, the ship that is the most beautiful of the most wonderful life for a few days a few days, rose also used to mark his life. Titanic holds 11 Oscars, the highest every grossing movie of all time and a critically acclaimed cinematic masterpiece. It took the world by storm in 1997 and still values plenty of positive credit to this day. To me, Titanic is no masterpiece, its a fictional love story on a real-life tragedy that struck in the youth years of the 20th century. Keep in mind there is terrific acting, excellent use of CGI and effects and some very suspenseful scenes not to mention the grueling emotions throughout the movie. Titanic created and extorted many famous memorable scenes to be remembered dearly in the future of the movie business. James Cameron directs a fine romantic movie, that was executed fantastically. The history, design and \\'feel\\' was all accurate and that\\'s one strong element that all other past Titanic movies didn\\'t have. A fine movie with exquisite acting and detailed cinematography. One harsh film critic memorably called this film, in his opinion, \"A wet blanket\". In my personal opinion James Cameron\\'s \"Titanic\" at the very least borders on a great film. A great love story is intertwined into the tragedy of this longish, but never boring, film. All in all it is not only an excellently entertaining film but probably both Kate Winslet & Leonardo DeCaprio\\'s finest hour. Whether or not a rich high-society woman would be capable of falling in love with a poor steerage passenger, (who won the money to buy his ticket playing poker), in real life is debatable, but I was able to suspend my disbelief. Leonardo DeCaprio plays a young man called Jack Dawson who is an aspiring artist & is excellent. Although from a working-class background he is worldly-wise & has been around. He meets Rose DeWitt (Kate Winslet) after he saves her life when she attempts to commit suicide. She is intended (mainly at her mother\\'s insistence) to marry a man named Cal Hockley played by Billy Zane. Rose doesn\\'t really love him & things have started to get on top of her. Mr. Hockley is rich but such an upper-class scumbag that you cannot really blame Rose for contemplating topping herself!. The courtship on board the ship between Rose & Jack is great & often done to the haunting theme music in the background which adds to the romance. The cinematography by Russell Carpenter is absolutely beautiful & is probably the single best factor of the entire movie. The filming of the ship striking an iceberg & eventually sinking is particularly well done. My final comment concerns the closing credits as Celine Dion sings \"My Heart Will Go On\". Everybody, it seems, from the films smallest bit-player extras down to Mr. Cameron\\'s tea lady gets a mention in the credits which really do go on & on & on! The number of people listed, but not credited, in the cast list is utterly astounding & I couldn\\'t help wondering what, (if anything?), they were paid. Undoubtedly one of the greatest adventures of all time, an already great movie now even more spectacular in 3D. This whopper of a movie spans three hours of beautiful sets, incredible visuals and a stunning cast who deliver performances so strong that you immediately connect with their characters.\\n\\nI\\'m not one for love stories or romantic dramas but Titanic is simply a must-see, as it\\'s blend of love, adventure and loss is incredible, and James Cameron is a master in suspense building. A few friends of mine say that they skip the first hour and a bit and just go straight to the sinking part, I told them that\\'s ridiculous, and the reason being is that you won\\'t care about who dies or the outcome at the end, you have to watch the whole movie, it\\'s a breathless adventure that will live on and be remembered as a classic. Everybody knows the story, but now it\\'s been re-mastered in 3D and it\\'s even more alive. The moment you see the Titanic the crowds look even bigger as they sprawl alongside the docks, cranes lift boxes which appear to lift off the screen and the sweeping shots that pan over the ship are just incredible. The depth throughout the movie is vast and jaw dropping to look at. All dialogue scenes boast incredible spacing between every little object from cups to candles, and I love the scene where Jack holds Rose over the edge of the Titanic and holds her arms out, you can almost touch them, this is the best 3D conversion to ever grace Blu-Ray. He nailed Avatar in 3D, Sanctum was a stunner in 3D and now James Cameron has done it again.\\n\\nThen there\\'s the climax, probably the most memorable and stunning climax in cinema history: The sinking of the Titanic. The scale here is mind blowing, as thousands of sailors and passengers flee in terror desperately trying to get on board the life boats, fighting for a space. I like how human nature and morals have been shown in this climax, how the crew leave the lower class people behind the shutters to drown which is saddening, and the greed and desperation of the upper class people fighting to get off the ship. The 3D here only heightens the terror, when passengers look over the sides the depth effects enable the viewer to tell just how far down the fall really is! The corridor scene where Rose and Jack try to flee is a marvel in 3D, don\\'t get me wrong the 2D counterpart is spectacular still but the way the water seems to leak our your TV screen is frightening. This whole finale will have you on edge, once the ship itself tips and sinks the depth just goes into overdrive, look at the distance from where Rose hangs dangerously to beneath her. I will highly recommend this movie in 3D, if you are lucky enough to get your hands on the Blu-Ray like me then you are in for one hell of an experience.\\n\\nI don\\'t really cry at movies, it takes an awful to get me weeping, even in real life situations but Titanic is a master tearjerker. For the last hour I honestly balled my eyes out, the soundtrack and score is wonderful as that peaceful vocal echoes in nearly every key scene. The four violin players stay to play their final performance as the ship goes down. The Captain goes back to wheel to go down with his ship. An elderly couple lye in bed as the water floods in. A single mother reads a bedtime story to her kids as their side of the ship goes down. Once the ship goes down more sad sets in. The sound of Rose frantically trying to shout for help, and when she lets go of Jack the tears start flooding in. This climax is hard hitting, lump-in-throat inducing and one heck of an emotional payoff. It gets sweeter when Old Rose drops her necklace into the Ocean, and when young Rose names herself Rose Dawson. This is as best as I can describe the beauty of the end. This classic story has never felt more alive, a fantastic conversion and still one of the epic movies of our time. TITANIC provoked polarized reactions from its first screening. For many, it was the greatest movie ever made; some patrons were reliably reported to have seen it more than thirty times, and it became by far the highest-grossing production in cinematic history. But a fairly large minority of people, both in the average film-going public and among the critics, felt that the TITANIC craze was much ado about nothing, and many of them bitterly resented its bloated budget which they felt could have gone to far worthier films.\\n\\nTwo years after its release, the ardency of TITANIC fans is no longer quite so hot, but its detractors seem to grow ever more bitter, and thus a backlash has snapped out against the movie that has driven it from its former place at number one (!) in Internet Movie Database voting to a place completely off the top 250. It\\'s become passe to like TITANIC, but I still like it. A whole lot, in fact. And while I don\\'t think it ever belonged in the #1 spot, ranking it below mediocre stuff like THE PHANTOM MENACE (#199) or FORREST GUMP (#172) just isn\\'t fair.\\n\\nTITANIC is the story of two fictional passengers on the White Star Line\\'s most famous vessel. Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is the child of a family high in social class but deeply in debt; Rose\\'s mother (Frances Fisher) plans to rectify this by betrothing Rose to the rich but odious Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a penniless dock-worker who has won his ticket on the TITANIC in a poker game. Rose, having gotten a good look at just what her future with Cal Hockley will be like, attempts suicide, but is stopped by Jack, which sparks a brief but memorably passionate romance between them, under the shadow of the disaster we know awaits the ship.\\n\\nIf you had told me in 1996 that James Cameron would direct a movie which had no violence or chase scenes for the first two hours, I would have laughed in your face. I honestly had no idea that Cameron was capable of gentle scenes so rich with humor, affection, and grand spectacle. The greatest ship ever launched comes to life and we get the grand tour, from the massive, throbbing engines to the graceful swanlike prow. We get a sense of just how grand this voyage was for all participants, rich or poor.\\n\\nLeonardo DiCaprio shouldn\\'t have been the sole focus of this movie\\'s popularity. Not that he does a bad job; he always delivers Cameron\\'s sometimes strained lines believably and sincerely, and he does some fine work in a difficult late scene where he has to mix fury and love in the same moment, simultaneously kissing and berating Rose when she stays with him rather than flee in a lifeboat. But Kate Winslet\\'s performance is the real meat of TITANIC. Her large liquid eyes can be heart-melting when she wishes. She perfectly simulates the mixed embarrassment and joy she feels as Jack teaches her to break down the inhibitions that her class and upbringing have placed on her. And at one point she delivers a kind of \"stuck for words\" expression that is so perfect that she couldn\\'t have done it better if she really had forgotten her lines.\\n\\nBilly Zane has a comparatively easy job as the villainous Cal Hockley, it\\'s a one-note role, and Zane plays it that way. While he\\'s certainly not the most interesting villain ever to appear on screen, comparisons of him to Snidely Whiplash are unfair. Hockley is not motiveless; he is merely one of those men who thinks of women as property rather than as human beings. There are millions of Hockleys in the world today, and you can see the wreckage they leave in their wake in any battered women\\'s shelter. Hockley\\'s character is perfectly realistic, just not particularly deep.\\n\\nMy favorite supporting actor in this movie was Victor Garber in the quiet and understated role of Thomas Andrews, TITANIC\\'s shipwright. Of his many fine moments, the best is his reaction to Bruce Ismay\\'s anguished protest, \"This ship can\\'t sink!\" \"She\\'s made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can.\" Almost any other actor handed that line would have delivered it with contempt and sarcasm. But Garber does it more with a mixture of disbelief and real pity, as he realizes that the man he is facing is emotionally incapable of facing reality.\\n\\nTITANIC certainly has many flaws. The framing story is sometimes mishandled, making the first half hour drag. The humorous wisecracks, while funny, are often very poorly timed and undercut the drama of the scenes. Since Cameron has to tell his story during the brief duration of the TITANIC\\'s voyage, Rose\\'s transformation from inhibited prisoner of class expectations to free and independent woman is too hasty. Cameron also at times seems intent on demonizing the rich just for being rich, a tad hypocritical for a man who risked and made millions on this movie. And the dialogue has more than its share of melodramatic lines and the odd cliche, though Winslet and DiCaprio deliver it so well that I generally didn\\'t mind.\\n\\nStill, there is great power in Cameron\\'s invitation to become attached to something you know is doomed. Some refuse to take the risk, but not wisely; everything that you become attached to is doomed, sooner or later. You get two choices: meet your own doom without ever having been attached to something at all, or meet it with at least the memory of how good the ride was while it lasted.\\n\\nRating: ***1/2 out of ****. Titanic is one of my favourite. Definitely not because of Jack and Rose\\'s boring romance and blah blah blah.But due to the emotional and disastrous effect it made. It could be even better if the romance sequences were cut short.\\n\\nNevertheless, its one of those classic movies not to be missed. Watched this movie for a second time recently with my 17-year-old son. He actually suggested the viewing, he heard about the movie and was curious. Rarely have I had a better entertainment experience with a family member.\\n\\nTitanic is just simply awesome, a movie that you just sit back and marvel at. Photography, special effects, costumes, production are just incredible, with a real feel of authentic time travel back to 1912. Musical score also sweeping and emotional, of course with Celine Dion\\'s favorite song and a wonderful orchestral sweep.\\n\\nA little more controversial is the screenplay and love story, which some commentators have portrayed as trite and even amateurish. What saves this movie, and in fact turns it into an instant classic, is that the characters are much more universal than they appear at first glance, and really have a great chemistry. Leonardo Di Caprio\\'s Jack is an underdog orphan that has suffered great personal hardship, Kate Winslet\\'s Rose is a young woman of great spirit completely stifled by her family and her society. You really can\\'t help but root for them, and the chemistry between the two is absolutely fantastic. Put this story in the midst of one of the great human tragedies of the 20th century, and at the very least you have a very potent formula, even if it is not executed perfectly at every turn. Often my son and I were laughing at some of the cliches in the midst of being completely absorbed in the unfolding drama.\\n\\nIf you love movies, you will love Titanic, it is that simple. It is an emotional, gorgeous, romantic, sexy, awesome spectacle of a movie. James Cameron\\'s record-breaking epic `Titanic\\' yesterday sailed into stores in the first DVD edition. Paramount has done an outstanding job of bringing the pictorial and auditory splendor of this film to its latest video incarnation. Watching this story unfold after about a year reminds one of what a cinematic masterpiece it is. Cameron has used many of the tried and true movie conventions to great effect. Slow motion enhances the lovers\\' flight through the engine rooms, using the glow of the furnaces to foreshadow the romantic scene to come and the ensuing tragic events. Instead of constantly bombarding the viewer with a blaring soundtrack, in the sequence just before the ship finally sinks, the director uses the spare violins playing `Near My God to Thee\\' as the Captain, the architect and other characters near their approaching doom. The sound design also includes some extremely effective use of surround sound as Rose (Kate Winslet) searches the bowels of the ship for Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio). The creaks of the near-collapsing hull of the ship envelop the viewer as does the sometimes soaring and sometimes-quiet musical score of composer, James Newton Howard.\\n\\nPerformances are impassioned all around. Kathy Bates is both humorous as she dresses DiCaprio and touching as she observes the foundering ship in its final moments. Francis Fisher portrays Rose\\'s selfish mother in such a way that even though she is selfish and bigoted, you somehow understand her. When she laces up Roses corset and explains her reasons for desiring a marriage for wealth rather than love, she holds a mirror up to the society of class distinctions that would be disappearing with the sinking of the ship. Eric Braeden has too few scenes as John Jacob Astor. However, he is perfect in projecting that image of new American wealth and class. Surely many of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. (In the excellent CD-ROM, `James Cameron\\'s Titanic Explorer\\', Astor searches frantically for his dog as the sea engulfs the ship.) Victor Garber is most sympathetic as Titanic\\'s architect. His final moments setting a clock as he awaits the inevitable is memorable. Bernard Hill is the Titanic\\'s Captain Smith. Hill imbues this oft portrayed character with a subtlety so you sense his frustration as he realizes that his hands are tied as the ship sinks from under him. In a scene with a steerage class mother who asks him where she must go to a lifeboat he just barely shrugs and turns away from her. Jonathan Hyde is the steamship line\\'s representative and a major heavy in his insistence that the ship break speed records and his quiet slinking on to a lifeboat to save his own neck. Incidentally, he lived the rest of his life in shame and seclusion.\\n\\nOf course, the tale is carried along by the expert thesping of DiCaprio and Winslet as the star-crossed lovers. Their travels throughout the length and breadth of the magnificent expanse of ocean liner give the viewer a perfect sense of the luxury and size of Titanic. Although their characters are fictional they bring them gloriously to life, so that in the end one really cares whether they live or die.\\n\\nOne hopes that Cameron will, in the future, release a Collector\\'s Deluxe edition including deleted scenes and a detailed `making of\\' feature giving the digital effects crew a chance to show how some of the fantastic special effects made everything seem so real. What made the effects so special is that they were unnoticeable. Cameron has made a film for the ages. It has earned all of the many awards it has won. Its place as a classic will only be realized with the passage of time. However, its records as the most popular American film to date will probably not be broken for many years to come. The fact that this movie won an Oscar for Best Film is one of the biggest disgraces of all time (it ranks right up there with Madonna not getting nominated for her role in Evita). Everyone loved this thing for some reason, but I found it lame and boring. I was so glad when the end credits came that I almost burst into hysteric joy! We all know the story of Titanic. Telling it through the eyes of ordinary characters would be dull. James Cameron smartly decided to make this a movie about romance between two lovers Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). I think the strong romance actually works and makes the audience care more about what happens to them, and of course, to the ship. This is a very sad story - as you might guess. The scenes after the ship hits the iceberg and everything goes haywire are shot with cinematic excellence. I believe this movie still remains to be the highest grossing films of all time and most number of Oscars earned. The only thing that bothers me every time Kate and Leonardo co-star in a movie, it is always Kate that gets nominated and Leonardo is always passed. I hope his day will come soon. As a teenage guy it may seem weird to hear that Titanic was a very good movie from my mouth, but it is. Leonardo DiCaprio was very believable in this movie and to a lesser extent so was Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart. This movie was very well created with excellent art-direction and cenematography. The sinking of the ship in this movie is so good, that when I saw it in the theaters I almost felt that I was in the middle of the Atlantic on a huge sinking ship. This movie wasn\\'t the best movie of 1997, LA Confidential was that. Still Titanic may be the best combination of very good acting and great special effects I\\'ve ever seen. **** out of **** for Titanic. This blockbuster is a milestone in film making and a career peak for Director/Producer James Cameron. When this film bowled over the competition (except in acting and writing categories) at the Academy Awards, it could be the occasion of a gleeful self-coronation (Mr. Cameron as \"King of the World\"). It had set box office records and was probably also record-breaking for multiple ticket purchases by teen fans of such a long epic. Like its \"older sister\" GONE WITH THE WIND, this Best Picture Oscar-winner exists in a self-enclosed quasi-historical environment where the beautiful survive and thrive despite morally despicable transgressions. It claims to be \"inspired\" by actual events around the sinking and recent re-discovery at ocean\\'s bottom. Those who love TITANIC feel that the mismatched couple outdo \"Romeo & Juliet\" as a most appealing \"eternal\" couple. Teen fans of Leonardo DiCaprio would gladly throw caution to the wind as did the lead actress who poses nude quite immodestly. As an unimpressed but still positive-minded fan of this movie overall, however, I have loads of questions to ask those who defend this as \"one of the all-time best movies\" (A.F.I. put it in the category of MOST THRILLING in its 2001 list recently). For example, shouldn\\'t a more specific disclaimer be attached to the closing credit acknowledgments about the ship\\'s crew and captain who are \"transformed\" unnecessarily and untruthfully into brutish villains? Since real names of actual dead are attached to some \"inspired\" crew and passengers, attentive audience members assume that those historical people who deserve blame (like Bruce Ismay) are those who did kill and threaten others and otherwise act like the most wicked people ever. Too many names can be exonerated and should be since this script took liberties with depicting the desperate, final actions of the crew. As a second example, why doesn\\'t Molly Brown get her lifeboat over to help those floating in life-jackets (in regular history, this IS (!) part of her claim to fame)? Furthermore, what happened to Fabrizio in the film\\'s middle? How is it that the 100+ year-old is unsupervised at film\\'s end? Does the special effects wizardry paper over and rationalize the simplistic \"chase\" elements of the film\\'s quite long middle? I felt a bit confused whether the drowned victims were mostly \"caged in\" by the class-bigots among the fictional crew \"stewards\" or if they were just too slow in figuring out a strategy like the romantic couple had as the Titanic goes down for the third time. Any help on these issues, Mr. Cameron and defenders of his script? I didn\\'t expect to know if time \"stood still\" when the ship takes on water but the film takes the \"worst spin\" on how the lifeboats get loaded and away in time to save only 1/3 of those aboard. Were these numbers strictly correct? The facts could have been a little better adhered to, in my opinion. Again, this is an amazing entertainment product and a Hollywood legend\\'s masterpiece. I just finished watching this on TV. It\\'s easy to see why this movie was initially overhyped and overrated, then trashed as nothing more than a pre-teen chick flick. In truth, it\\'s a lot like \"Dances with Wolves\", a big screen three hour plus epic that grabbed a fistful of Oscars, then p***ed everyone off by beating out what many thought was a superior film (for \"Titanic\" it was \"LA Confidential\", for \"Wolves\" it was \"Goodfellas\"). I don\\'t know if it was Oscar material, but it was definitely better than the critics now claim. On the plus side, no expense was spared in getting every detail visually perfect. I don\\'t know how he did it, but James Cameron managed to thoroughly convince his audience that it was the real Titanic we were seeing. And the sinking scenes were amazingly real, enough to grab the heart of the most jaded movie goer. On the minus side, far too much time was spent on the fictional romance between Jack and Rose. The story of the Titanic itself contains so much drama that wasting two hours on this love affair was simply not needed. In short, this could have been THE film of the 1990\\'s, instead it ended up as a good, but not great, money-making blockbuster. Such a lot of care was taken, so I\\'m told, with most aspects of the accuracy of this movie. If that is so, I cannot understand why one of the most important facts is glaringly wrong, and that is the name of the ship. It was not the SS Titanic, but the RMS Titanic, i.e. The Royal Mail Ship Titanic.\\n\\nI could be wrong, but I think it must be taken with a pinch of salt that the sketch left in the safe could have really been in such pristine condition after 80 years at the bottom of the Atlantic, protected or no.\\n\\nIt was an excellent movie in regard to the computer imagery, and a marvellous treat for those unfortunates who wallow in disaster for their entertainment. I\\'m not one of them, and only really watched it out of curiosity after all the hype. I couldn\\'t see what all the fuss was about, and for me even the a pitiful sub-plot couldn\\'t save it. It\\'s not a patch on \"A Night to Remember\" and that was in black and white with no computerised aids.\\n\\nOne last comment; I can well understand an upper class girl falling for a working class bit of rough, even in the second decade of the 20th century. What puzzles me is how they managed to enjoy love-making in Arctic conditions, and in the back seat of a freezing car. Brrr! It doesn\\'t bear thinking about. Titanic sinks itself on technical, artistic and ethical reasons. Firstly, the script is horribly corny and tedious. Everyone speaks as though they\\'re one day out of acting school, over-emoting even the simplest, most minor of thoughts. I never felt anything genuinely warm or tender between the two stars. For a 3+ hour movie, there\\'s ridiculously little time spent on character development. And the shallow clichÃ©d narration of the old lady gets extremely tedious.\\n\\nSecondly, the effects do not hold up today, in 2011. You might say that\\'s an unfair criticism, to hold a 14 year old movie up to modern technical standards. The effects, it turns out, are the only part I originally liked back in 1997. At that time I would have given the movie a 6 or 7 just for the visual spectacle. It now looks dated and awkward, and it\\'s just not enough to justify any effort to watch it today.\\n\\nFinally, and most importantly, the story just falls down by not playing up the doubts and fears that many people had at the time of the ship\\'s construction. There were experts in maritime engineering that forewarned of such a possible catastrophe, but neither the owners nor the public were concerned. The notion of being able to safely maneuver such a Leviathan was loudly challenged by nautical men, but the Great Ship is presented as an unquestionably positive, glorious achievement. The film conveys that it was entirely the fault of chanceâ\\x80\\x94an act of nature, a freak accident, a stray icebergâ\\x80\\x94that downed the ship, and not ignorance, pride, hubris. As it is I was waiting eagerly for it\\'s inevitable demise, I almost felt everyone deserved it. James Cameron should have gone down with his tremendous, beautiful beast.\\n\\nAnd it certainly is beautiful. We are treated to near pornographic views of gleaming stacks, sumptuous accommodations, and throbbing mechanical drives. The best of society are so eager to participate in this obscene orgy of excess, but Mr. Cameron wants me to feel sympathetic with these self important gluttons. OK, so Leonardo and Kate are \"different\", but still they are deluded. Their only crime, perhaps, is their youth, so yes, their story is a tragedy. Their standing on the bow of the mighty ship is an iconic image that\\'s truly impressive, but there\\'s no underlying sense of conscience to give it high contrast. It comes off as just a shallow, slick promotional ad for the cruise line.\\n\\nMy point is that I feel it\\'s so sad to see how seemingly convinced people were that technological marvels were proof of man\\'s superiority and divine place on Earth. We now know that such absurdly over-sized endeavors truly only serve a very few at the great expense of very many. And it\\'s happening today right now at an at even more frantic pace. We are doomed if we stay the course, but \"Titanic\" celebrates the choice to not reconsider our way. By intentionally creating such a tremendous sensation in our culture this movie, Mr. Cameron, and every one involved in some way took on a responsibility to reward our attention with something worthwhile and substantial. It does not. It purposely avoids any such responsibility or awareness. It is pure escapist fantasy of the highest order that defies it\\'s viewers to question any of it\\'s splendor. I find this insulting to be expected not to think for myself. That\\'s just so depressing, and so tragic in ways which James Cameron is apparently oblivious.\\n\\nI feel that this film is just too much fluff and glitter, not worthy of it\\'s efforts and costs. We are supposed to be smarter today about not living for such trivial wasteful excess. It\\'s exactly this kind of consumption that is accelerating our ecological decline and inflicting extreme hardships on so many millions of disadvantaged people the world over. That\\'s a very big heavy thought, for sure, but this massive movie is just asking for â\\x80\\x94 demanding â\\x80\\x94 this kind of consideration. Titanic omits the most important compelling bit of the story. The old lady\\'s love may live on, but her planet is sinking... When Billy Zane took out his pistol and began firing at the fleeing lovers, I thought to myself \"Oh puh-leeeeze! We\\'ve got the biggest maritime disaster in history going on here and the director feels he needs to provide MORE drama?! And CONTRIVED drama at that?\" To me it just crystallized the absolute creative and emotional bankrupcy of this movie. This film has the freedom of young people , and the humanity that people show in the face of disaster. Think carefully about the love described in this movie that transcends class and life and death. Let\\'s face it, nobody wants to spend three hours in a movie theater anymore (except those people who have no lives). This film was too long and drawn out. Not only that, but it also has the same problem \"Apollo 13\" had: Everyone knows whats going to happen. This makes the film dull and boring. nan If I can take a time machine back to 1912, I must be excited as a journalist.The pride of the iron and steel industry era, the maiden voyage of the so-called unsinkable giant ship, is worth being recorded in history.In 2017, when I read the history of journalism, what was recorded on the paper was not a miracle but a disaster.However, there is a beautiful and sad story in the disaster.In fact, falling in love with a person takes only a moment. It was the most amazing movie two years ago, but in 2000, the flawed fiction account of the most famous ship in history seems overstatingly unbelievable. Attempting to be faithful to fact while making Leonardo look overwhelmingly good to drag girls around my target age group to the box office now makes me embarrassed to be once part of the phenomenon that once was. Unfortunately, fact could not combine with romance on that one with a director who seemed more intent of running bills into the millions of dollars to break into the record books.\\n\\nI will not be entirely venomous towards the movie, because it was after all, at one stage, my favourite movie. Kate Winslet\\'s performance was perhaps the best in the whole film, but her lower key and lower profiled Oscar nominated performance in \"Sense and Sensibility\" as Marianne still exceeds this one entirely. She has a knack for costume period drama in a good showy part, but she has done better work elsewhere.\\n\\nWhat once seemed to be perfection of movie making is quickly becoming evident with its misconceptions of film making. The screenplay at the time, and the musical score seemed completely breathtaking, but now merely looks the complete fluke that had enough star drawing power to get people to hand over their cash to the box office. Celine Dion assaulting the world with a maudlin ballad about a sinking ship of course increased the movie\\'s success to a greater extent than it deserved.\\n\\nPerhaps the art decoration, costume design and cinematography will outlast some of the mediocre elements disguised beneath the surface of the gloss. The \"Titanic\" hype lasted long enough to secure a record equaling amount of Oscars first reached in 1959 with \"Ben-Hur\".\\n\\nDuring the 1990s, the Academy seemed to be handing the best picture statuette to the wrong pictures, with the exception of \"Schlindler\\'s List\" and \"The Silence of the Lambs\".\\n\\nWithout a doubt, it will retain its place in history as a movie epic for all the generations. But it is certainly no \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"Casablanca\", and in sixty years we\\'ll be wondering what we were thinking.\\n\\nRating: 5/10 nan This is a great movie no matter what anyone says. The storyline, actors.. everything is just wonderful. I personally think that Gloria Stuart should have gotten the oscar for her portrayal as \"old Rose\". She did a wonderful job as did Kate Winslet, Leo DiCaprio and Billy Zane. This is one movie that I will never get tired of! Evidently the reputation of this blockbuster continues to nosedive, like the ship, and like DiCaprio\\'s standing as he loses his teenybopper following. He has failed to grow out of his chrysalis (will he ever? Tom Cruise is pushing 40 and still coming on like a 20 year old). I feel the movie sets up quite an intriguing fictional frame quite skilfully in the first 20-odd minutes- not unlike \\'King Kong\\'- and then blows it the moment Rose\\'s mother utters the words we\\'re all praying not to hear: \"They say she\\'s unsinkable\". More\\'s the pity, this comes just after the amusing tease of not showing Rose as she alights from the cab until we\\'ve peered under her big Edwardian hat.\\n\\nFrom then on, dialogue cliches, anachronisms, falsifications of historical fact, national stereotypes and the absurdities and contrivances of the plot pile up until the film\\'s credibility is foundering long before the vessel does. Why do the lovers make out in a car (is this a first?) when she could have smuggled him into her stateroom with its four-poster bed? Note too how in between their 1990s-style bursts of nookie the star-crossed pair manage to be on hand for every plot development. It\\'s Rose who quizzes an admiring Andrews about the lifeboats\\' capacity, and she and Jack are snogging at the very moment of impact- which is far more juddery than in reality, since few passengers noticed it. Somehow Rose wades through freezing water for minutes on end, clad in her filmy dress, without taking any harm: I know Dame Winslet\\'s naturally well insulated, but not even a sneeze?\\n\\nIt\\'s beyond a joke when Murdoch, a gallant officer, is smeared as a corrupt suicide: Cameron had to pay $8,000 to charity to make up for that bit of hokum. But many of the errors are venial, and some grisly enjoyment can be drawn from the spectacle of multiple death, just as a little can be had from the curiously cursory contemplation of the ship\\'s luxurious appointments in the earlier scenes, which experts have warranted authentic.\\n\\nOn the whole, though, sitting through these three hours feels like being forced to drink an enormous, sickly cocktail. For relief, try the pure draught of iceberg-cold water provided by the British antidote: Eric Ambler\\'s and Roy Ward Baker\\'s \\'A Night to Remember\\', which sticks to documentary reconstruction and distils more pity, terror and catharsis than Mr Cameron\\'s $200m budget and tin ear could begin to generate.\\n\\nPS: When people rave about \\'Titanic\\'s\\' box office- as if numbers guaranteed quality- tell them that inflated 1997 ticket prices are responsible for most of it. Tickets sold (\\'bums on seats\\') for the great popular epics of the past, such as \\'Gone with the Wind\\', were far more numerous. nan Titanic is one of the most epic films of all time this 1997 tale is about the maiden voyage of the most popular ship in history the Rms Titanic. The film opens up with a under water discovery of the ill fated ship, it sank over 84 years ago and now Brock Lovett (Paxton is discovering old artifacts. He comes across a picture of a young woman lying naked on a couch and is soon contacted by Rose Dewitt Bukater Calvert (Stuart) she was the girl in that picture and soon Rose tells him and his crew her story about what happened in the days before the sinking. Kate Winslet is beautiful as Rose Dewitt Bukater and Leonardo Dicaprio is adventurous as Jack Dawson. This film deals with the romance between the two characters and the tragedy that occurs. Titanic is both romantic and sad better get out the tissues girls this is a must see movie. 10/10 TITANIC Titanic is one of the year\\'s best films. The story is based on actual events of the tragic Titanic voyage. Since everyone knows what happens to the Titanic, James Cameron adds a interesting twist to the story. A ship in the present sends a probe into the Titanic to locate a diamond but instead finds a picture of a naked lady. The lady who is in the drawing calls the man who found the picture. She tells her story about her time spent on the Titanic.\\n\\nThere is a lot interesting scenes in the movie in addition to being powerful and dramatic. It is a very long movie but the time passes so well that you don\\'t even notice that much. The shots of the Titanic in some scenes were quite good. This movie is definitely a must see especially on the big screen. Rated PA One of the saddest and most tragic stories, frightening when it comes to the disaster in a certain way. One of the most important films in Cinema history so definitely a must watch and 10/10. nan \"Titanic\" is one great film that never falters in length, talent or action but is not ever to be considered THE #1 film of the \\'90s. It may come as ONLY a close second behind \"Schindler\\'s List\". Kate Winslet is a promising character actress but Leo DiCaprio is destined to play only contemporary parts well. His take on Romeo in \"William Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet\" (1996) was very 90s despite the faithfulness to Will\\'s original script and Jack in \"Titanic\" was very much the same. \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" was pretty much of a flop on his part also. Billy Zane, after playing dozens of supporting parts now has a chance of proving himself a good leading man (such as shown in tv\\'s \"Cleopatra\" as Mark Antony last May). Gloria Stewart made a tremendous comeback after 45+ years with her portrayal of Old Rose but millions were shocked when she didn\\'t win the Supporting Actress Oscar. Who did it go to? Miss Kim Basinger! Notorious for playing a prostitute in every movie she\\'s made. Kathy Bates is a perfect choice to play the \"Unsinkable\" Molly Brown and Frances Fisher is a narrow-minded wretch of a woman as Rose\\'s mother Ruth, one who only cared about herself and her position in society. Now for sheer spectacle and brilliant music, action and tension, \"Titanic\" may qualify as the best ACTION movie of the decade but not on a general \"all-in-all\" scale as a unique drama. \"Ben-Hur\" (1959) finally met it\\'s match as the Oscar-winning champ when \"Titanic\" tied with it as the film with the highest number of Oscars (11 in all for both). And the ever-popular \"My Heart Will Go On\" by Celine Dion is probably the greatest song written for a film since \"Moon River\" of \"Breakfast at Tiffany\\'s\". But let\\'s not get carried away and glorify \"Titanic\" as the best film of the decade! This film is one of only a select few that has had the privilege of winning 11 Academy Awards, and with good reason. It is clearly one of the best films of all time. I got the privilege of seeing it earlier this year in 3D. I had already seen it before, but my parents said that it was quite the experience seeing it in theatres. They could not be more correct on that.\\n\\nThe story is that Rose, an upper-class citizen, is engaged to a wealthy man named Cal. However, she feels trapped in her world, and she is almost pushed over the ledge when she meets Jack, a lower-class citizen. Despite their difference in social status, they take a liking to each other, despite Cal\\'s and her mother\\'s hatred of Jack. Despite their social status and everybody against their pairing, the two fall deeply in love, when suddenly... well, if you know the story of the RMS Titanic, then you know the rest of this story.\\n\\nJames Cameron, you are a master filmmaker. You\\'ve done it with the Terminator movies, Aliens, True Lies, The Abyss, and you have also done it with Titanic, as well as Avatar, which is my favourite movie of all time. What Cameron is great at doing is creating a story in which the first part tells the story without all the crazy stuff happening, so that when the second part/final action scenes come, we know who to cheer for when something good happens and who to cry for when something bad happens. He did it with this movie, he did it with Avatar; it is a great way of providing the audience with amazing special effects and action sequences without them being too distracting from the movie.\\n\\nI must also applaud the acting. Gloria Stuart is amazing in her supporting role, and she shares much of her screen time with Bill Paxton, who also does great, despite the limitations he gets in this film. Frances Fisher is great as the overbearing mother, who seems to only care about money, and not about her daughters\\' wishes. Kathy Bates lightens up the screen with her witty dialogue as Molly Brown, while Billy Zane is great as the antagonist, Cal.\\n\\nHowever, it is our two leads, Leo and Kate, who truly shine here. They would later go on to act in Revolutionary Road, and both films show their chemistry well. If these two became a real-life couple, I would not be surprised, as they seem to have a whole lot of chemistry on screen.\\n\\nOverall, this movie is a triumph. If you have not seen it, stop reading this, turn off your computer, go to the nearest DVD store, and buy it. The dialogue might be a little cheesy for you to handle, but the actors are great, the story is great, the direction is great, etc. Overall, a 10/10 for me. Ok ok ok... There is nothing wrong with Leo Di Caprio except that us guys wish we had his looks... His acting in Titanic was sub-par, but I\\'ve seen him do very excellent jobs in This Boy\\'s Life and Romeo and Juliet, so I can\\'t knock him for one average job. I\\'ve also seen Winslet do a better job, despite her Oscar nomination. James Cameron is a great special effects director, and I think some day people will look at him as one of the great influences of 1980\\'s and 90\\'s popular film. I enjoyed the film, although I did not LOVE it, but that\\'s ok. The music was appropriate, if a little overdone, but the romance was great. No, I am not a fan of romance, but obviously for millions of girls out there it was VERY effective. Bravo to Cameron, and if it made more money than some of us think it deserved, well, that\\'s showbusiness! This is probably the best example of a critic\\'s grudge against a terrific film. Yes, the love story is clichÃ©d and unoriginal. So what? Everything else is flawless. The effort James Cameron spent with the historical accuracy is commendable at least. Not so many times we can see a film set in a certain time period with appropriate costumes, set designs, silverware, etc. Even the actors were cast to be almost identical to their real life counterparts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn\\'t find the dialog bad at all. There are no lines passing for catch phrases, like in other big budget movies. The visual effects, I\\'m speechless just to think about them. Even the love story, cheesy as it is, was greatly written, like in the old days. The acting was great, almost obliged to be great. The characters were amazingly portrayed, and Cameron made sure every single death would ache your heart (except for Lovejoy), something nobody really can do nowadays. Of course, there is the nude scene with Kate Winslet, something for all those pre-teens out there, and the little sex scene inside the coach. Aside of building up the romance between Rose and Jack, both scenes prove to be a little pointless. Even though, James Cameron is who actually draws the Rose picture, so that really gives more of an artistic merit. Music, well, it\\'s good, and I don\\'t mean just that song you all know. James Horner\\'s score is actually very good, part of his list of great works.\\n\\nOne critic spotted several technical errors in the movie, one of them being the sun\\'s position during the \"I\\'m flying!\" sequence at the wrong side. But hey! If you want to find the bad stuff, you\\'ll find it. That\\'s not what film-making is about. You don\\'t go to the theater to shred to pieces any single movie you see (we got MST3K for that). Titanic is one of those few movies that is timeless to this day. I can only compare it to Casablanca, or more specially to Gone With the Wind. It\\'s larger than life, it\\'s long as hell, but it\\'s enjoyable every single time you see it (I forgot how many times I\\'ve seen it on TV alone). If only James Cameron could write dialogue!\\n\\nThis is a well-produced fictionalization of the Titanic and her maiden voyage, with all the historical details just right (well, except for some really minor stuff ...). The romantic story overlaying it all lends poignancy and drew in the crowds, in record numbers. The performances are, by and large, good-to-excellent, except for Leonardo DiCaprio, who did much better in his earlier movies (up to and including The Quick and the Dead), and Billy Zane, who\\'s never been able to do more than look like a movie star.\\n\\nCameron is a great director of action, and a good visual story teller. Too bad he\\'s such a control freak, he ought to allow someone to re-write all his dialogue so that it sounds like humans talking, not T-1000\\'s.\\n\\nI give this a \"five\" only because the \"seven\" it\\'s currently averaged at is too high. Titanic is one of the best movies of the decade. Interestingly, it was the official script book that got me to notice this film ... since I took pains to IGNORE Titanic when it first came out. I thought the hype was a bit too much, and I really hated Celine Dion\\'s performance on an otherwise excellent song. Now that I have seen the film, I can\\'t see what many people are complaining about. The b-story of Jack and Rose\\'s romance is touching and never dull, the historical facts are generally accurate, except for a few minor errors. But a lot of people forget this film is told from the point of view of a 101-year-old woman! I rarely find myself choking up watching a film, but this show did it to me -- the only other movie ever to make me cry is the excellent Hawks (1989). Repeated viewings of Titanic only make the experience better, because you get to see different things each time. By the way, anyone staying away from Titanic because of Celine Dion will be happy to note her song doesn\\'t appear until the closing credits ... the rest of the time James Horner\\'s exquisite work carries the film. Love story with a famous historical backdrop. An astonishly well-groomed steerage class passenger catches the eye of a beautiful, haughty first class passenger aboard a doomed ocean liner. Technically excellent film sunk by soap opera script, inane plot and television-quality acting. But if you\\'re a fifteen-year old girl, who cares? (Rating: B) Titanic is my favourite film off all time. I can watch this film night after night and never get bored of it. Every time I watch it I feel like I experience a range off different emotions to the previous time watching it. Titanic is just such a beautiful thing it really does win the heart of the audience, the film makes you cry and laugh it is a tale of history and romance. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Jack Dawson a character you can\\'t help but fall in love with. This is one of James Cameron\\'s brilliant pieces of work. I would recommend this film to anyone, It is beyond me how people can say they don\\'t like this film I mean what is not to like? `Titanic\\' has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made, and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but puerile, overrated garbage. The truth lies somewhere in between - `Titanic\\' definitely shouldn\\'t have won the Best Picture Oscar in 1997 (), but to dismiss the film as utter crap is very unfair. `Titanic\\' tells a complex tale, and, for the most part, tells it very well. The fact that parts of this tale are either predictable or flawed shouldn\\'t be ignored, but it also isn\\'t enough to turn `Titanic\\' into a rotten movie.\\n\\n`Titanic\\' has a slightly predictable story, but most films involving a well-known historical event tend to be predictable. Before the movie even starts, anybody watching `Titanic\\' should be able to predict a few things: The Titanic will set sail in glorious fashion, with its owners grandly proclaiming its unsinkable nature; there will be a story about the passengers, some fictional, some real; the Titanic will sink in a slow and horrible fashion; and while the ship sinks, the characters will be forced to deal with their own mortality, and some will be heroes while others will be craven cowards. See? Predictable. It doesn\\'t take a genius to realize that the historical nature of `Titanic\\' dictates this story structure. After all, it\\'s the structure James Cameron actually uses. But the execution of that structure . . . well, that takes some talent, if the film has any aspirations of being good. It means blending action, romance, drama, and historical accuracy. And James Cameron blends them all splendidly.\\n\\nThe main story concerns a young girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), traveling to America in order marry an arrogant millionaire named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). The marriage, which has been arranged by her formerly rich and now-destitute mother (Frances Fisher), is abhorrent to Rose, so in a desperate attempt to escape her fate, she attempts to jump off the ship. Of course, she doesn\\'t jump, but is instead saved by the happy-go-lucky Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and of course the two begin a brief, if implausible, romance. This romance, which is perhaps the weakest part of `Titanic\\' is still vitally important to the story . . . because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg, and about the choices they make. Could it have been better? Absolutely. But considering that the romance is a means to an end, rather than the end itself, it\\'s not bad.\\n\\nDiCaprio is superb as the wide-eyed vagabond Jack Dawson - he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why Rose would fall in love so quickly with him. Winslet\\'s slightly less believable, though; she\\'s good, but not great. She puts in a nice, quiet, restrained performance, but it\\'s so restrained at times that it borders on comatose. It\\'s actually the minor characters that add some zip to `Titanic\\' - Billy Zane is outstanding as the villain Hockley, as he gives Hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed, arrogant person, and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a Flash Gordon serial. Also worthy of note is the modern-day interaction between deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the Titanic. No only does their interaction serve as a brilliant, unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the Titanic\\'s final hours to the audience, but Paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience - as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting, it\\'s a neat touch to see his character Lovett become more and more fascinated with Rose\\'s stories.\\n\\nIt would be remiss not to mention the special effects of `Titanic\\', which by and large is the film\\'s strength. While the ship (and its sinking) is a product of CGI effects and model works, it\\'s done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself, or reminds the audience that they\\'re watching a movie. Of more importance is that the film\\'s effects, while spectacular, never ARE the film - they always SUPPORT the film\\'s story.\\n\\nThere are many things to nit-pick about `Titanic\\' (although I find it hard to believe that people really nit-pick the minor historical inaccuracies of the film; Cameron got all the major details right, and the films probably more than 95% accurate, for crying out loud). But those problems are nit-picks - very tiny but slightly irritating details, nothing more. They keep the film from being an all-time great, but they certainly don\\'t make it a bad film. The blend of romance, action, history, and special effects probably explains the film\\'s vast appeal - there\\'s certainly something for everyone in this film - and it also makes `Titanic\\' an excellent, if not perfect, movie. Grade: B+ Titanic, being the most expensive, most publicized, and highest grossing film of all time (at least as of 2003, who knows what the future holds) is one of those films that can either be loved by soft-hearted individuals who love a good story or a well-made piece of cinema, or hated by movie buffs who consider it \\'over-rated\\'. Personally I think it\\'s a little of both.\\n\\nEssentially the real winner of the film is obviously the cinematography and the visual effects; the sinking of the ship is truly a masterpiece of realism and is a shocking perspective on what the sinking of the actual ship might have been like.\\n\\nBut aside from the technical side, the film is nothing more than a simple love story, and it is actually quite badly portrayed; the terribly over played comments on class structure and the neverending possibilities of love clash extremely sharply with the very under played relationship between Jack and Rose; there is never a spark between them, and it seems such a short period of time between Jack talking Rose out of killing herself and the two suddenly copulating in the back of somebody else\\'s car in the hold of the ship. It\\'s almost as if James Cameron couldn\\'t decide which elements of the film to over-dwell on and which to just touch upon, because the development of the relationship is one that he could easily have stressed more definitely.\\n\\nThe performances as well leave something to be desired. While I have been a long-serving advocate against the talents of Leonardo DiCaprio, this movie is in my opinion, easily his worst. He lacks all the elements that make up a classic film character; charisma, empathy and credibility. As so often ruins a good performance, throughout the entire movie, he is making such an obvious effort to act and it is so apparent visually that the character is lost, and apart from that, it is not a difficult role to play. On the other hand, Kate Winslet is better although not brilliant; she does have charisma and empathy and we can enjoy the character of Rose a lot better. The minor characters are another good element of the film. They don\\'t sparkle but they fill in the story nicely, as minor characters are supposed to do. Jonathan Hyde is excellent as the ship\\'s designer, I felt truly sorry for him when the news is finally broken to him that the Titanic is not, as previously thought, unsinkable.\\n\\nOverall, Titanic is a behemoth of film-making, but that is not quite enough to make it a true classic. It seems too cute, too much like a daytime soap opera to make it a milestone of cinema. Titanic is impressive, nothing more. And while I quite enjoyed watching it, it can never be more than a three star film for me. nan What I think I\\'ll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, \"Phantom Menace\", is that it will likely blow \"Titanic\" out of the water, if you\\'ll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare \"Titanic\" is the greatest film they\\'ve ever seen, I think to myself, \"You don\\'t see a lot of movies, do you?\" What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than \"Titanic\", and for the same price tag.\\n\\n\"Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,\" as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald\\'s, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.\\n\\nI\\'ll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn\\'t live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It\\'s true, \"Phantom Menace\" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.\\n\\nJames Cameron\\'s \"Titanic\" is. a) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b) a three-hour epic that has it\\'s finest moments given away in the trailer. c) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something left better to documentarians, which I would\\'ve enjoyed much more. e) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f) a robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn\\'t seen it yet, I say, \"I wish I could trade places with you.\" g) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h) thankfully a film that wasn\\'t recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i) a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.\\n\\nThe only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who\\'ll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic\\'s story, acting or length. A 7.0? Are you kidding me? I have read all the comments on this movie and let me say, there is just absolutely no need for them. Isn\\'t it funny how in the winter of 1997 everybody was going to see this movie, some multiple times, helping it become the highest-grossing movie ever and now they all hate it? I feel bad for Cameron, hopefully he never gets on this website and reads this crap, because he is very talented. Tell me what, exactly, is bad about this movie? Every single excuse I\\'ve heard for people hating it are biased opinions based on stupid things. They say they don\\'t like it because of Leo. Okay, there are about a dozen other actors BESIDES Leo here. And he wasn\\'t even that bad, come on, get a freakin\\' grip! A little note to people who get on here and TRY to be movie critics: you don\\'t rate a movie on the likeability of an actor. That\\'s a selfish OPINION. It\\'s like saying \"I hate Pretty Woman because Julia Roberts wears a red dress and I hate red.\" Please. Sure, I get the fact that the love story is somewhat cheesy. But that\\'s only in certain parts of the movie and the movie is over 3 hours. Some more advice: don\\'t rate a movie in pieces. Commenting on the beginning love story and the end with the sinking, what is that all about? A movie is one whole piece of work. How can you just show a ship sinking and not set it up first with a beginning? Everything about this film is spectacular. The music, the sets, the effects, the themes. It shows how Titanic not only changed the world, but the very lives of the people on it. If you\\'ll notice at the end, none of the characters ever really recovered from it. The love story is essential to take you on the inside of the tragedy and see it how people that were actually there saw it. From a victim\\'s eyes. And if you laughed at this movie, then your heart is as cold as the iceberg that sank this ship. Do you laugh when a bomb goes off, killing people? I hope not. 1500 people DIED on this ship, many suffering one of the most horrible deaths (drowning) and never even getting a chance to save themselves. Those that didn\\'t drown were tortured by freezing to death. Stick your hands in ice water and tell me how you would feel being totally immersed in it, slowly dying. Children and babies died. Think about that and tell me how cruel someone has to be to laugh at that. Cameron makes you feel for the people on the ship, something other Titanic movies failed to do. By creating characters we care about and ripping them apart, he creates a true tragedy. It\\'s not a comedy. The last hour is one of the most exhilarating movie experiences of all time. And so is this movie. This is possibly the only case in which a film once so popular will go down forever as being \"gay and a piece of trash.\" I guess it\\'s a good thing reviews like these aren\\'t published. Leave that to the professionals, who by the way liked it. nan Titanic {dir. James Cameron, 1997} (*Â½/****)\\n\\nSomewhere on its way to becoming the all time box office champion and biggest Oscar winner of all time, James Cameron\\'s Titanic etched out a place in my mind as the one film that can most easily send me into a frenzied rant against the dangers of big- budget, epic film making. Sure, I might not have put it that way when I first saw it (I was seven) but, upon first viewing I knew that this film was nothing special. Four years later, I was able to identify it as simply money thrown onto the screen with little room left for intelligence, emotion or character. Yet even as I professed the evils of this production and its vapid screenplay (penned by director Cameron), there were those who maintained that Titanic was an achievement. Among those people are esteemed film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert , both of whom included it on their top ten lists of 1997. Those celebratory citations led me to revisit Titanic again recently, for the first time on DVD, a disc which preserves the film\\'s original aspect ratio and presents the clearest available picture and sound. The Verdict: As the old truism goes, \"You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig.\"\\n\\nThe film isn\\'t all bad; the cast is solid (considering the material..but more on that later), the score is rich, the cinematography is evocative and the production design and visual effects are impeccable. Yet as it turns out, all these elements do not a great film make. Titanic\\'s greatest weakness lies at its very core: the screenplay. It reaches a level so wretched that I will be blunt in my metaphoric criticism. Cameron\\'s script isn\\'t just a turd, it is a floater; it refuses to just be flushed away to haunt us no longer. It insists on having an epic length and employing a framing device that may very well be the cause of a sudden onset of narcolepsy. I\\'m sorry to resort to such infantile comparison, but I believe that is best to convey the utter insult that is Cameron\\'s screenplay. I consider myself a romantic, yet the so-called romance of this film left me cold, with nothing to do except roll my eyes. The film lacks any new vision or originality, and that can never be commended.\\n\\nI\\'m fed up at this point; three viewing, each one revealing an un-plundered area of Cameron\\'s incompetence. This film remains an interminable, and wildly popular, mash of tired formula only be idolized by starry eyed tweens. If you like to turn off your brain for three hours, watch this. I am not saying this in a negative way because sometimes you just need a sappy movie to take to bed. Not everything has to be Shakespeare to be enjoyable. So get some chocolate ice cream and a glass of red wine and don\\'t think for an evening. Trust me, it will be fun. nan There is more wrong with this film than anyone could possibly say. I honestly don\\'t know where to begin.\\n\\nRomance is bad. Reasons.\\n\\n1)I am not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to romance, but isn\\'t there more to it than nude portraits and life saving? Also where is the attraction to a guy that looks like a woman? Yes Leonardo DiCrapio acts a little effeminately to be loved as Jack Dawson our so-called hero, or at least I think that is what everyone thought he was, he isn\\'t at all, and you know why? It is simply because that if Rose Dawson (played badly by Kate Winslet, I\\'ll explain later) hadn\\'t known him she would have gone home happily without losing anyone close to her, and she wouldn\\'t have jumped, no way would she, and if she had at least the film would have been over quicker, and also he is totally repulsive, especially to the male half of the audience, I mean really who is this film for?\\n\\n2) Attraction. I don\\'t know how each character was attracted to each other. How can Jack be attracted to Rose when she is spitting over the side of the ship? That\\'s disgusting even for me, never mind an effeminate person like him. Also if it\\'s true love why didn\\'t Rose make more room on the floating door, which she could\\'ve done easily. He might have lived if she had, heck even Jim Carrey spotted that in the film Bruce Almighty.\\n\\nActing? Reasons why it is also crap.\\n\\n1) Winslet acts like a snob for the first part and then like a tramp, would anybody demote themselves like this? When the kid drowned in the corridor, and when she fell off the side of the boat she hardly screamed. Why? Some say she was strong. peh... Almost everyone would have screamed in those situations. I have no idea what her face expression and posture was meant to say when Leo was arrested for possessing the planted diamond, I think she was upset, maybe angry, maybe about ready to laugh? I do not know, she had NO EXPRESSION.\\n\\n2) Leo was the same, NO EXPRESSION. Cameron directed people to act like gormless puppets, one face for every situation. Totally unrealistic.\\n\\n3) Rose\\'s family of snobs were stereotypical, I don\\'t like the stereotype at all. Snobs are not just money-grabbers, I am not particularly rich, but I\\'d like to be. With the way that each stereotype acted, it seemed that the poor wanted to stay poor, and the rich wanted to be richer. I don\\'t think people really act like this.\\n\\nThe directing is bad. Reasons.\\n\\n1) James Cameron couldn\\'t direct traffic. His style is crap, and revolves around two kind of people a) People who have one prime desire, and nothing else, and this doesn\\'t remotely resemble reality at all - b) The other group are people who have one stereotyped personality. These are mainly Snobs, the poor and the ship staff. James Cameron should have worked to establish more realism within his characters, only Kathy Bates can be praised for achieving this.\\n\\n2) The special effects are too lavish. The boat is too glammed up, and anyone who says the boat looks \"real\" is a total moron. A film needs to be more than special effects. He could have worked a little harder on the acting instead.\\n\\n3) Cameron\\'s camera shots were mediocre to say the least. A few shots that were particularly bad include. The one where he shows us the whole ship from far out, I do not know what he was trying to achieve, my guess is that he was trying to show us how isolated the ship was, but this is pointless as we already knew it was isolated, you can\\'t get more isolated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Another example of camera shots is to do with the exchange of angles. He too often flickers back from person to person, why can\\'t he keep the camera in one place? He may as well have pointed it at the moon, that\\'s more interesting than a random mess of pictures.\\n\\nBad plot. Reasons.\\n\\nIt is meant to be Rose\\'s story, and I think it should have only included her accounts. But instead it had bits that made no sense. such as.\\n\\n1)The two old people cuddling, getting ready to die. 2)Plates falling from shelves. 3)The captain drowning on the bridge. 4)The dome shatters and everyone inside drowns These events are shown, yet in accordance to where Rose is during the film it doesn\\'t make sense that she should have known about these things. Why add bits? My guess is to add to the sentimentality and drama but the overall realism and straightforwardness is lost thanks to this. Boy I hate this film.\\n\\nOscars? It Shouldn\\'t have won a single solitary thing, never mind 11. There are flaws. Bigguns. No denying it really, it is totally true that almost every aspect could have been cleaned up considerably.I don\\'t care what anyone says. I find it unbearable to watch this garbage. There is a lot more than this, wrong with this diabolical film, but I have a 1000 word limit. So all I can really say to conclude is that this film for me if not for you - SANK. nan nan nan nan Titanic is one of my favorite movies, and it is a timeless classic that did not receive the acclaim and respect it deserved. I know that it got Oscar nominations, and it received the hype, but its not even in the top 250 which is very disappointing, because Titanic is as least as good if not better than many of the movies in the top 250. It is unfortunate that it was unpopular among so many people. During its day it was the highest grossing film of all time. Unfortunately the success and hype of the movie have spawned vicious criticism.\\n\\nA lot of viewers love Titanic, but many more bash the film and dissect it for problems such as its \"lack of originality\", \"weak script\", and \"poor acting\", all of which are overly critical and not true. Maybe the script could have been a little better, but it was good enough for me. It may have been simple, but it was still well-written in my opinion. I don\\'t know why everyone say\\'s the acting is bad, I thought all of the cast did very well in this movie. As for the originality, its not the first love story to be told, but in my opinion it is the most believable, epic, and heart-wrenching love story to ever be depicted in a movie. The love the two characters have for each other is totally convincing.\\n\\nTitanic does use a historical setting to set the foundation for the movie, but so do a lot of other great movies. A lot of people say they don\\'t like Titanic because it was too long, but I don\\'t think the movie\\'s length is a problem because it\\'s so good that it\\'s worth the 3 hour commitment. Sure, it could have been a little shorter, but I don\\'t know that it would have been made that much of an improvement. Titanic is indeed a very lengthy film, but the movie is breath-taking because of its strong plot, gorgeous cinematography, phenomenal special effects, and superb acting. A lot of people don\\'t like Leonardo Di Caprio in this movie. In fact, many of the people who didn\\'t like this movie blame Di Caprio. Leonardo Di Caprio is not really respected as an actor but often dismissed as a \"pretty boy\". Leonardo Di Caprio is not the greatest actor ever, but he did a good job in this movie, and I find the attacks on his acting to be unfair. In my opinion he did his best work in this movie.\\n\\nKate Winslet is perfect in Titanic. She is a very gifted actress who is part of what makes this movie so good. But she didn\\'t do it alone: The chemistry between her character and Leonardo Di Caprio\\'s character is so natural, that it does not seem like they acting at all. Kate Winslet plays a young woman from a rich family named Rose, and Leonardo Di Caprio plays a poor artist named Jack. The two meet on the voyage of the Titanic and fall in love. But Rose is strongly encouraged to marry a rich man named Cal Hockley. Rose\\'s family and Cal disapprove of Jack. Throughout the movie Rose and Jack\\'s relationship develops, much to Cal\\'s dismay. Cal becomes the enemy of both Rose and Jack. He hires a man to capture Jack.\\n\\nA real ocean liner was built for the production of this movie. It is not quite as big as the real Titanic but it is close to it. The replica of the ship looks very authentic, it looks just like the real ship. Titanic may start off a little slow, but it is still very engrossing, in my opinion. The second half of the movie is unforgettable. It is tense, suspenseful, and compelling. Watching this movie makes you feel like you were really on the ship. The movie does include some characters that really were on the ship, but Jack and Rose\\'s characters are fictitious. I\\'m not sure how accurate the rest of the movie is, but the reality of it all is impeccable. Titanic is a riveting movie that really draws you in to the disaster and the tragedy of that night.\\n\\nI would certainly recommend Titanic, to all audiences. Do not listen the hype though, and do not listen to the criticism either. Just watch the movie, and make your own opinion. If you leave your cynicism at the door, then you may just discover the beauty of this movie. When you first hear about Titanic you immediately think you know whats going to happen (if haven\\'t seen the movie yet you will) you\\'ll think a sinking ship, a quick romance blooms, and a tragic story, well your right. But something about this is different from what you would usually see in a movie with this story.\\n\\nJust about everything in this movie is beautiful including the story, the music, even the tragic ending. When I first heard of Titanic I didn\\'t really care for it at the time. When I was wondering how could this be the first movie to reach a billion dollars and stay the highest grossing movie of all time I decided to watch it and see why other people love it so much. And now I\\'m one of those people. For those of you that haven\\'t seen Titanic it is a must-see film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make the perfect on screen couple in Titanic.\\n\\nThis is a movie about two different class people that fall in love with each other and they are shunned for it. Rose (Kate Winslet) is a upper class woman being forced to marry a man she doesn\\'t love while Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who makes a break getting to go to America again on Titanic. Simple really what happens next he saves her life they fall in love and something tragic happens the end. But how it comes about is really amazing the special effects and the script make such a simple story amazing.\\n\\nThis is probably one of the most amazing, beautiful, and purely spectacular films of the 1990\\'s. A must-see for all movie goers. It\\'s a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. Period. I pity those who haven\\'t watched it yet or didn\\'t like it. I once had a dream. A vision, if you will. I had the idea that when I died at age 92, on my tombstone would be the words \"LAST WOMAN ON EARTH TO NEVER SEE TITANIC.\" I thought I could do it. But, just as the Unsinkable Ship took a swift nosedive to the ocean floor, I too, hit an iceberg, and in a moment of weakness, watched The Epic. I was the out-spoken, Titanic-bashing zealot who claimed \"it couldn\\'t possibly be that good! It\\'s all effects!\" Well, my attitude hasn\\'t changed much. Now, with my melted resolve, I ask, what was all the hype about? The \"I\\'m king of the world!\" was just too much. I suppose knowing Leo was going to turn Human Popsicle sort of ruined the moment, too. The effects were impressive, but I just didn\\'t feel involved. Yes, Leo\\'s a looker, and I assume men say the same of Kate, but I was looking for something more. I like Leonardo DiCaprio, I think he was excellent as Jack Dawson, and I think too that he deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his work. \"Titanic\" deserved to win Best Picture, and I really don\\'t care what sort of flak I\\'d probably get for saying all that, but I like \"Titanic\". I was 12 when I saw it, and I remember clear as day being touched by it. It may be tacky, sappy, or just plain unbelievable, but \"Titanic\" is one of the more memorable movies I\\'ve seen. It\\'s basically mindless entertainment brought to life by a group of actors who can really act (DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, etc). It\\'s mindless entertainment that tells a rather corny but moving tale of two people brought together and torn apart by fate, and it\\'s mindless entertainment that just *happened* to make millions at the box office, and just *happened* to scoop Oscars left and right. What are you going to do about that?\\n\\nWhat I like about \"Titanic\" is the simplicity of its plot (yes, it has one). I hate to reiterate, but a story about two different individuals falling in love while they\\'re on the legendary Titanic doesn\\'t get anymore complicated than that. Call me a sap if you must, but my attempts at swallowing the huge lump I had in my throat when the film concluded were futile; one cannot help but be touched by Jack\\'s sacrifice for Rose. And it also helps that there\\'s real chemistry between DiCaprio (who\\'s a truly gifted actor) and Winslet, and again, you can\\'t help but want them to be together. I usually stay away from romance films as a lot of them are crap and have retarded plots, but \"Titanic\" is an exception. It\\'s 3 hours long, and throughout those 3 hours, there\\'s not a boring minute.\\n\\nLet me first declare that my admiration for DiCaprio has got nothing to do with looks. I have just recently became a huge fan of his, and if it\\'s got to do with looks, shouldn\\'t I be obsessed (for lack of a better word) with him 3 years ago? Having that said, despite what a lot of people think, DiCaprio is more than a teen idol or a pretty boy with no acting talent. Jack Dawson may not be an awfully hard character to play, but DiCaprio excelled in his role, like he always does. He\\'s one of the most talented actors of his generation (others include Joaquin Phoenix), and his works before \"Titanic\" should more or less prove that.\\n\\nSomething to ponder about: If \"Titanic\" was an independent movie with a budget of much less than what it had, would you hate it too? My best comment for this was that offered by my then 13 year old granddaughter. When one of her friends gushed over it, her only reply was, \"Let me guess... There\\'s either a rich boy and poor girl, or a rich girl and poor boy. The ship sinks. One of them dies. Right?\" There are so many great real stories to be told of the Titanic, why do almost all film makers feel compelled to invent a contrived, maudlin story line?\\n\\nOf course, unlike her friend, my granddaughter already knew the stories of the Strausses, Wallace Hartley, John Astor, Benjamin Guggenheim, Molly Brown, and so many others.\\n\\nIf James Cameron had simply chosen to use all his skill and special effects budget to tell the sort of honest story told in \"A Night To Remember\", it would\\'ve been an all-time great. As it was, it alternated between brilliant and annoying. I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend seeing for all. It\\'s a movie to watch with your family by far.\\n\\nMy MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disastor, nudity/sexuality and some language. nan nan Let me start off by saying that there really can\\'t be any spoilers about this movie, as anyone who knows anything about history already knows how this film will end. The Titanic is going to sink! What a surprise! There are three major reasons why I don\\'t like this movie.\\n\\nReason 1: We know how the film is going to end before we even see it. The ship is going to sink. If filmmakers want to make a movie in which the audience already knows what is going to happen, they need to do a better job than to simply turn it into a sappy love story. Which brings me to the second reason.\\n\\nReason 2: This is another historical event turned into a sappy love story, blended in which a whole lot of Hollywood inaccuracy. The acting is terrible, and the characters are very uninteresting.\\n\\nReason 3: Time. This movie is more than three hours long! Is that really necessary? No it isn\\'t. It is a three hours of my life that I could have used way more productively. It is a three hours of my life, gone forever! Wasted! And I can never get it back!\\n\\nI was thankful when DiCaprio died, because I knew the movie was almost over. I can\\'t believe this movie got so much praise. Its right there in the same league as \"Pearl Harbor\". Pure, un-adulterated junk. I gave it a 3/10, only because they did a pretty nice job \"reviving\" the ship itself. Don\\'t watch it. If you take my advice, you have just saved three hours of your life. Really, why all the commotion over this movie? This schmaltzy soap opera bubble gum puke is way overlong, with every character some cartoon cliche\\'. With dialouge so frickin\\' corny that just made me want to throw a brick through my TV screen. Even at the end, that rotten, stupid cow could have let Leo share the plank she was on, but no, she decides to let him die! What the hell is up with that! When are people going to realize that all the special effects in the world aren\\'t going to compensate for jejune scripts such as this one. It too bad that Cameron didn\\'t line a few bird cages with his script to this manipulative, sugar coated bore-feast, if he would have, it would have put to good use. nan nan nan Cameron\\'s alleged masterpiece has two things going for it: amazing digital effects and the fact that the vessel broke in half.\\n\\nDozens of excellent real-life stories are abandoned for an an insipid love story.\\n\\nSee the excellent \"A Night To Remember\" instead.\\n\\n0 of 4 Niro~Stars Any human being who considers \"Titanic\" to be among the top 250 films of all time should be strapped to a chair in a small room and be forced to watch any Tom Cruise vehicle several hundred times. In pan \\'scan format.\\n\\nLike so many awful Best Picture winners which came before it, \"Titanic\" does a horrible injustice to its so-called intended \"heroes\"... in this case, by stereotyping them, making them dispensible.\\n\\nThe most recent B.P. winner to have borrowed this technique is Costner\\'s aberration, \"Dances With Wolves,\" which pretended to be about the plight of the Native Americans, whose country we literally stole from them, and turning it into a fable about how one __white__ man rises above his equals to \"appreciate\" the former. See \"Black Robe,\" \"Little Big Man\" or \"Soldier Blue\" instead.\\n\\nThe politically~correct \"Driving Miss Daisy\" suffers the same fate: it should be about Freeman\\'s character, which is infinitely more interesting than Tandy\\'s.\\n\\n\"Forrest Gump\" is nearly as insulting, by changing the book in such away as to take the worst of Gump\\'s traits and failings and foisting them on the Robin Wright Penn\\'s \"Jenny\" character, leaving sweet Forrest a saint and Jenny a slut. \"Pulp Fiction,\" also released in 1994 has already had a greater effect on filmmaking than \"Gump\" ever will.\\n\\nAnd __that\\'s__ not even Tarantino\\'s best film!\\n\\nDespicable.\\n\\nWhile we\\'re at it, let\\'s add to this list of garbage which has recently won Best Picture: Mel Gibson\\'s lamentable \"Braveheart,\" which, while sporting excellent large~scale battle scenes, is nearly entirely fictional.\\n\\nMore proof that Hollywood\\'s elite still like guys who\\'ve paid their dues in front of the camera.\\n\\n\"Gandhi\"??? Don\\'t even get me started on that Best Costume Design Oscar, let alone its B.P.\\n\\nThe trend may have begun in 1939, with the single most overrated flick of all time [\"Gone With The Wind\" of course] beating out at least seven better films made in the same year.\\n\\n~Niro The announcement that James Cameron\\'s 1997 blockbuster, Titanic, was to be rereleased to mark the centenary of the ocean liner\\'s disastrous maiden voyage was met with a considerable amount of vitriol from historians and cultural critics.\\n\\nAlongside the somewhat more sober events set to take place on 15 April to commemorate the sinking of the \\'unsinkable ship\\' - including an exhibition in Belfast, where RMS Titanic was built, and a series of seminars in Nova Scotia, close to where it sank - many saw this as Cameron once again cashing in on the tragedy with his fiercely sentimental film. The fact that it has been remastered in 3D has made its release feel all the more in poor taste.\\n\\nI was all of six years old when Titanic first hit our screens. It was, of course, one of the biggest blockbusters of my childhood. So large was its impact, in fact, that on several occasions during my schooling I was subjected to Titanic-themed history and art projects, all of which involved watching the three-and-a-bit-hour behemoth as a primary piece of research. In the years since, it has become the nostalgia movie of choice among my friends. So I\\'ve seen it more times than I\\'d care to count. Seeing it remastered on the big screen, however, made its inadequacy as a historical film more laughably evident than ever.\\n\\nGiven the policed divide between the haughty classes of the upper decks and the lowly paupers of steerage, and the shameful priority given to the wealthy when it came to filling the lifeboats, the Titanic tragedy has often been held up as a telling snapshot of the class politics of the time. Through the star-crossed, and completely fictional, love affair between penniless rogue Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and drippy debutante Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), Cameron attempts to explore the inherent tensions which the ship contained. This rendering, however, is reductive to say the least: the gilded dining rooms of first class are populated by sarcastic, brandy-swilling poshos and the steerage is full of arm-wrestling Germanics and Guinness-guzzling Irishmen who are prone to punch one another or break into a fiddle recital at the slightest provocation. Probably the most coherent message about class we are given, as the two lovers move between their respective camps, is that it\\'s much more fun to dance a jig below decks than it is to discuss oil prices over caviar.\\n\\nThe stories that survived the ship\\'s demise are a mix of startling inhumanity and incredible heroism. But Cameron\\'s manipulative approach often robs his material of its inherent pathos and breeds drastic historical inaccuracies. In its turbulent second half, poignant moments come thick and fast, but many of them are either wholly fictional or shamelessly skewed for the sake of taking some cheap tugs at the heartstrings. The \\'unsinkable\\' Molly Brown, who in the real tragedy insisted the half-full lifeboats return to collect those still stranded in the ice-cold water, is robbed of her triumphant moment and recast as a much less domineering symbol of feminine subordination. Similarly, as is widely known, the ship\\'s string quartet played on top deck as the Titanic went down, in order to calm the passengers, but even this incredible part of the tale is soured by the schmaltz Cameron lays over the scene. As the quartet finish their rendition of \\'Orpheus and Eurydice\\', one of the violinists turns to his fellow musicians and says, \\'Gentleman, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight\\'. Such candy-coated moments continually deaden the impact of the film\\'s rich source material.\\n\\nCameron once quipped that he only agreed to make the film because a free deep sea dive to the Titanic wreck came as part of the package, suggesting this was never intended to be his magnum opus. Indeed, given the director\\'s famous meticulousness, the film feels like he has been oddly careless in places. Kate Winslet\\'s accent is allowed to wander between American, Irish and English with little consequence, and despite a rigorous casting process for the part of Rose\\'s malevolent fiancÃ© Cal - which saw innumerable famous actors rejected - the appalling Billy Zane was selected, who ends up playing the role like a camp Count Dracula.\\n\\nDespite all this, the clunking one-liners, the dreadful acting and the cheesy artifice actually gives Titanic its distinctive charm. When watching the released film on the big screen, I was surprised to find that most of my fellow audience members were giggling along at all of the abysmal moments, which also had kept me returning to it over the years. For myself and others it seems, this film is more of a trip down 90s memory lane than it is an historically accurate snapshot of a turn-of-the-century tragedy. As such, criticising Titanic on the grounds of historical infidelity is tantamount to damning Top Gun for giving a rose-tinted portrayal of the lives of fighter pilots - doing so would be to miss the point of what makes these films so memorable.\\n\\nI completely agree with those who feel Titanic has no place in the proceedings for the centenary of the original tragedy. Not because Cameron\\'s tacky blockbuster does a disservice to the 1,517 people who lost their lives, but because this film is so inescapably naff that really it shouldn\\'t be taken that seriously. I urge fans to go and enjoy this guilty pleasure with a clear conscience I would like to say I really liked Titanic in terms of suspense and being in the grand mode of other classic long drama movies like \\'Gone with the Wind\\'. The acting was good and other aspects like social class, hierarchy and set design issues/props was excellent.\\n\\nOn the other the hand, the sex scene (though brief) was unnecessary and distracted from the romance element, certainly not following the scenes of other classic older movies of a non-explicit nature. Other post-modern features was the types of language used by Kate Winslet as Rose, some profanity and constant use of God\\'s name in vain. Notwithstanding these problems the movie shows quite impressive what can be done with 100\\'s of millions of pounds.\\n\\nI think that movies that cost that much and makes a sizeable profit should have at least a proportion given to charity for the real people who are freezing to death, are ill or of great need for food. This will help prevent future disasters in the world.\\n\\nPeace and love to everyone. Titanic\\n\\nDIRECTION 98% Lovely amounts of accurate details and the ship sinking is a tour de force.\\n\\nACTING 73% The unsinkable Molly (Kathy Bates) was great. Kate Winslet got an oscar nomination. But the others may have to learn more for next time.\\n\\nEDITING/SPECIAL EFFECTS 100% Can you get more realistic than this?!\\n\\nPLOT 45% The weakest part of the filmÂ\\x85Â\\x85. but some people like pseudo love stories!\\n\\nSTRONG WORDS AND VIOLENCE ETC 86% A brief sex scene which should not be there. Oh of course people dying every second when the ship is sinking.\\n\\nMUSIC 100% Sheer joy so get both James Horner albums, with Irish music sounding like this and Celion Dion rumbling away you probably listen to the music than watch the movie.\\n\\nSOUND 96% Incredible effects like the ship sounds, the crackling of the stern and the human noises crying for help against the rushing of the waves and the debris.\\n\\nHOOKABILITY 98% When you see the computer models and underwater cameras you want to do aqua driving as soon as possible!\\n\\nLASTABILITY 98% You do want the ship to sink don\\'t you. Then fast forward the middle \\'non-romantic\\' section of the movie.\\n\\nOVERALL 83% Though the movie captures your senses, it leave your brain in neutral. I was going to see a movie one snowy night in December. My friend suggested Tomorrow Never Dies but I was wanting to see Titanic sence last summer. I was expecting a disaster movie but I got a lot more. This movie takes you to the ship in 1912. You\\'re there. You see it. You feel it. It\\'s actually like you\\'r ea part of the movie. This movie wasn\\'t really all that great in script writing, but how many are? Most guys say this movie sucked and had no point. I think they just weren\\'t man enough to admit it. If you feel like reliving history, than you should see this. The end is so creepy because you feel like you\\'re there. You can\\'t help wonder what it was like for those unlucky passengers. The effects of the ship sinking was VERY realistic and this movie was definitely worth the 200 million it took to make it. I admit the end is sad but that makes it all the more realistic. It\\'s one of the greatest movies of all time and the most successful of all time and one of my favorites of all time.\\n\\nRelive the past and see this movie. I still don\\'t see why anyone thinks this is one of the best movies ever. This is a good movie, not a great one. The screenplay was simply ridiculous. It doesn\\'t even look like the inside or outside of a ship. It actually LOOKS like a stage!\\n\\nLeonardo was terrible. He made no attempt at playing a young punk. He simply played himself. He was magnificent in What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape, but hasn\\'t done anything since worth watching. He\\'s simply a pretty-boy who cannot play this type of role.\\n\\nThis film is filled with lots of good actors in pathetic roles. Kathy Bates is one of my favorites, but her character in this was horrible. It represented absolutely nothing, had no substance, and was completely fictional.\\n\\nFictional...that\\'s what this movie was. From the start, the \"foggy\" appearance of the movie, which was supposed to give you the illusion of the early teens, just made the movie look like poorly-drawn animation. This was obviously an attempt at making a classic. This is a recipe for disaster. Classics were never meant to be classics. They were meant to be movies. Try making a good movie, and it might become a classic. Try making a classic, and its lack of substance will cause it to break apart into tiny little pieces.\\n\\nThe good thing about the movie was the final scene in the water. This was a marvelous job by DiCaprio and Winslet.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this was just another example of the public being sucked into an extremely high-budget, over-publicized pathetic movie. One of the interesting things about this film is that it\\'s pretty clear how Titanic and Avatar are both cut from, essentially, the same cloth despite being two completely different films on paper.\\n\\nAs it is widely understood, a lot of time, effort, and money went into making this film possible and it shows. Aside from a couple moments here and there, Titanic is still a fairly impressive looking film to date. Of course, nowadays there is more information about Titanic\\'s interior design with the aid of 20 more years of research behind us and, thus, there are some inaccuracies in this film in that regard, as well as the way the ship sank, but overall, it is clear that they went to painstaking lengths to make this film look as accurate and authentic as possible and I think they succeeded. Of course when you have James Cameron at the helm, usually films end up turning out looking quite impressive so it\\'s no surprise that this film would be any different.\\n\\nHowever, James Cameron is also one of the reasons why this film falls very short of what it could have been. This has much to do with the quality of writing and its execution. Cal Hockley is little short of a diet James Bond villain and I have no idea what his motivations for pursuing his obviously aloof fiancee aside from serving as an antagonist for Jack. The guy shows no interest in Rose, yet he says he loves her and it seems like the film, at some point, is trying to frame him as being truthful about it- but who knows at this point? On top of that, there\\'s also the same writing trap that this film fall into as Avatar would years later with the very cartoonish poor people good, rich people bad theme which only ages worse when one looks into the real reasons why ships of that time were organized by class.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a lot of blatant misrepresentation when it comes to a myriad of issues including the crew of the Titanic and the ship\\'s lifeboat situation-which are all comments made with the aide of hindsight- which makes for a pretty bad representation of history.\\n\\nOne of my biggest criticisms of this kind of love story is that usually the female lead is fairly plain and the male lead is where all the personality and likability is. For Titanic, the reverse is true. Rose is extremely likable and has a lot of personality and Kate Winslet is the star of the show, in my opinion. Jack is quite plain on the other hand. I know DiCaprio is a popular actor but I didn\\'t feel as if he really added anything to this role. It just seemed that they hired him to play himself.\\n\\nDespite my criticisms, this is still a pretty well-made film. It has a lot of issues but it is still worth seeing. The love story is predictable but I don\\'t think people watch romance films for their expectations to be subverted anyway. It\\'s far from a bad film, and despite its 3 hour run time it makes excellent use of it. This is probably the date night film to end all date night films until The Notebook came out at the very least that says something. James Cameron\\'s \\'Titanic\\' shares a similar motto to Marmite, \"you either love it or hate it\", I for one love this film, yes I know it\\'s got a drawn out romance story, but there\\'s just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original \\'A Night to Remember\\', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron\\'s romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it\\'s become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron\\'s other epic \\'Avatar\\', and whilst \\'Titanic\\' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it\\'s just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone\\'s eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner\\'s haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film\\'s success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, \\'Titanic\\' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on. Without doubt, the worst movie ever to win the Oscar for Best Picture. A ghastly script, which, feeble-minded and cliche-ridden as it is, proved far beyond the infantile acting ability of the stars left one rooting for the one real hero--that vast block of ice that sank the ship and took us all out of our misery. The music is bad, the plot is absurd, the much vaunted realism in recreating the boat was done just as well forty years ago (in A Night to Remember); this is just further proof that the ability of audiences to see movies has deteriorated due perhaps to a combination of food additives and computer graphics. It\\'s not even bad enough to be funny; it\\'s just flat out bad. I have been fascinated by the story of the White Star Line\\'s most luxurious liner that sank on her maiden voyage, ever since I first learned of it 20 years ago, and my Dad would always say \"And they STILL don\\'t know where she came to rest...\" Remember, it wasn\\'t until 1985 when National Geographic found the wreck.\\n\\nI have many books, articles, and video programs about the history of the RMS Titanic, it\\'s people, and it\\'s impact on the entire world following the tragedy.\\n\\nWhen Cameron\\'s \"Titanic\" debuted in the theater, all I heard was how great the love story was. I didn\\'t think that any film that put fictional characters in a real setting, especially one as dramatic as the Titanic disaster could succeed. I was wrong.\\n\\n\"Titanic\" is an excellent film in all respects. Both DiCaprio and Winslet have a realistic and charismatic chemistry with each other. Kathy Bates was born to play the role of Molly Brown, Billy Zane is wonderfully despicable as the intended husband for Winslet, and Bernard Hill lends a great deal of respect to his role as Captain John Smith.\\n\\nBut the real star is indeed, the ship itself. It is absolutely phenomenal how the filmmakers recreated the legendary ship for the film. The grand staircase with the carving of hope and glory crowning time, the staterooms, the ballroom, the smoking lounges, all replicated with incredible attention to detail.\\n\\nThe details surrounding the sinking were incredible as well. I believe this is the first motion picture to address the fact that the ship split in half as it sank, instead of going down whole. The entire sinking sequence is incredibly chilling and you will not be able to turn your eyes away from it.\\n\\nIf you are one of the few that have not yet seen Titanic, watch it soon, and see if it doesn\\'t amaze and move you.\\n\\nAnd by the way... if you find yourself in Orlando, FL, check out the Titanic exhibition. You won\\'t be disappointed. This movie is like the source of life, it filled me with different emotions, I felt real warmness, I felt suspense, I felt empathy. It filled me with good emotions, refreshed my mind in some way, I absolutely in love with it. And I think, everything about this movie is great, EXCEPT scenes from \"nowadays\" : I can\\'t see any emotions on the face of this old lady, I hate this thing, when she tells something and It feels like I SHOULD feel sorry for this non - acting bag with bones, because I KNOW that she is Rose, this is the point when me and you MOST feel sorry, cheap trick. No hate to this actress, but to the director, I just hate this useless old living. Nobody ever asked you to invite 87 year old actress, if you can\\'t find any acting one, then cut this scene, use cosmetics, do anything that not harms the movie. I think that all those scenes spoils the great movie and without them it can be called a masterpiece. These people are useless, they take my time, they don\\'t do anything, these scenes not ever look that great like Titanic story itself! All that they do is playing cheap emotional games \" feel sorry for me\"; \"look at something you know\" and this is disgusting! I feel really mad about that part, and I feel sad for such a great movie. I would recommend you to skip all of them and enjoy this piece of art. Rose can die for love, but at last, under Jack\\'s life-saving and pleading, he chose to live for love, and the man left behind was miserable. When rose, who became an old woman, stood by the boat and threw the heart of the sea back into the sea, I think that was its best destination. In the face of disaster, some people leave the chance of survival to others, while some people spend money to occupy the opportunity of others. What can I say that hasn\\'t already been said? This film really is good. A sweet little fairy tale turned into a tragic and thought provoking story. True there\\'s a cliche romance between a princess and a pauper,but I can think of no better princess (my favorite actress Kate Winslet) and no better pauper (the boyish but talented DiCaprio). Unlike the bloated and \"let\\'s make you tear up and hey, James Cameron did it let\\'s just pick another historical event\" Pearl Harbor, this film some how stays with me and manages to jerk a tear or two even the 43rd time I\\'ve seen it. My friends and I mock this show at times but deep down, if we admit it or not, we all love this film. It really do think it will stand the test of time. Jame\\'s Cameron\\'s \"Titanic\" struck a chord with movie goers of all ages for one simple reason : it moved. As corny and implausible as the screenplay is, Cameron nevertheless seamlessly weaved historical fact with soap opera fiction to create a movie that hearkened back to Hollywood\\'s Golden Age. Is \"Titanic\" the equal of \"Gone With The Wind\"? Not by several knots. But it is a monumental production by any standards and in 1997 was the most sensational thing to come down the pike since the glory days of David O. Selznick and David Lean. \"Titanic\" is a grand, immensely entertaining extravaganza. Went to watch this on a date because, my then GF wanted to see it like most of the female population.\\n\\nIt rumbles along at a steady pace with not much happening apart from some good effects and a boring love story. The story between the two lead actors feels awkward and false. It is a bit of a bore to be blunt but the special effects save it.\\n\\nTypical Hollywood romantic dross.\\n\\nThis is not a film for men!\\n\\nBe safe - stay away!!\\n\\n5/10 nan nan Titanic Released in 1997 to me this movie is very long some of the effects are dated and yea it didn\\'t age well yes you can tell were the CGI is there are a couple of times were stuntdobles apare there is a Secne were you can see the end of the set the most memorable thing about this movie is when Jack Yell\\'s I\\'m the king of the world. I don\\'t like movies that are made by the rules of \"hollywood filmmaking\". What I mean by that is the way to make the audience sad, happy, worried, thrilled, are all the same way that all the same in all big budget hollywood films. Titanic is another one of those films. So it didn\\'t give me anything.\\n\\nJames Horner\\'s music sucked! And I was so mad at him getting the undeserved oscar for original score. That year the statue should have gone to Jerry Goldsmith\\'s original score for L.A. Confidential! The popularity of Titanic shows how easily entertained the average movie going audience is. How does one describe the perfect film? In order to answer this question, one must watch the perfect film. In this case \"Titanic\" is the perfect film.\\n\\nIt owned all the qualities that make a film #1: action, drama, suspense, romance and action. \"Titanic\" is the personification of excellence and perfection.\\n\\nIt contained brilliant performances by Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane and Kathy Bates. I was truly impressed by the performance of Billy Zane\\'s Cal who was the jealous fiance to Kate Winslet\\'s Rose. The casting director knew what he was doing when he chose Zane because the role was played with such ease.\\n\\nThe set design and costumes that overseen by Director James Cameron was done with careful attention to detail. The accuracy of the set and costumes was superb it was not easy to tell the difference whether or not it was made or real.\\n\\nI have seen \"Titanic\" many many times and will continue to see as long as I own the movie because it was that well done. It continues to hold a special place in my heart and will for as long as I live.\\n\\nThis continues to be one of the best films I have seen; everyone should SEE IT again. \"Titanic\" is an excellent movie! It\\'s very dramatic, emotional, overwhelming, magnificent,... I was really impressed when I saw this movie, and I don\\'t think I can say anything negative about it. Some people say that in the whole first half of the movie nothing happens. I don\\'t think that way about \"Titanic\". From the first moment the two saw each other, you felt there were already sparks between them. Also the music is vÃ©ry beautiful! This is a fascinating movie: it\\'s dramatic, gripping, emotional, sometimes exciting, the acting is also good, the music is marvelous. One of the best movies ever made! If you haven\\'t seen it, you should try to see it as soon as you can! Excellent work from director James Cameron, the whole cast and the whole crew! O.K., let me get something straight, I do not regard Titanic to be a masterpiece. However, considering that this movie rates 7.0 here in imdb and Lord of the Rings is third in imdb (last time I checked), there is something really wrong.\\n\\nTitanic is not as bad as many of the reviewers are trying to make it. The soundtrack is well done, the acting is good. At that particular time, the movie effects are also pretty good. The movie do appeal to the audience\\'s emotions, mostly duing the second half of the movie. I do feel for the characters in the movie even if they are not that believable. Overall, I think this movie deserves 7.5/10.\\n\\nAnd besides, I think at least this movie is in the same level as LOTR, which is also worth a 7.1/10 This is a typical \"rich girl meets poor boy\" story, but it has got so much more than that. First of all, a great cast: Leo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates and many more. They were all good. And the special effects were awesome! I mean, really, I have never seen anything like that before (or maybe I have, I just can\\'t remember it). The point is that this movie captures you for like three hours, and never once did I look at the time and see how long it\\'s been or how long it\\'s left.\\n\\nThis movie deserved all the Oscars, all the credit and all the good reviews. I love this movie, a classic movie, and I can\\'t imagine how anyone would think it\\'s bad or that it didn\\'t deserve all the credit it got.\\n\\nWatch it and enjoy it and don\\'t think about how long it is. Some of the greatest movies of all time are like really long. Thanks :) Before anything, let me say that this was a very good movie: the special effects were incredible, and the final hour was spellbindingly powerful. And if the entire movie had been about this, had been about the Titanic itself, then I would have loved it. However, it wasn\\'t. Instead, it supplies us with two and a half hours of a boring, predictable, badly written and badly acted romance that is no different than any other movie romance that has been seen in the past 10 years. Let\\'s see: a pretty girl is engaged to a rich snob because of pressure from her parents, and then a young drifter (who looks suspiciously like a 25 year-old model) \"rescues\" her, and they fall in love. Gee, no cliches so far. Some of the script was awful. For example, at the beginning, Rose says, \"You think you can save me?\" and Jack responds, \"No, only you can do that.\" That\\'s fine, except then at the end, old Rose tells her granddaughter, \"there was a man named Jack who saved me, in all the ways a person can be saved.\" Which is a total contradiction to what Jack told her. And the worst line of the whole movie (or any movie I\\'ve seen in recent years): the ship is going down. Right in front of their eyes thousands of innocent men, women and children are dying. So what does Rose do? She looks at Jack, smiles, and says, \"Look honey, this is where we first met!\" How dramatic! I wanted to puke. I realize that I\\'m nitpicking here, but my point is, if you\\'re going to make a drama about such an important event, why give us two hours of watching Kate Winslet spit over the edge of a ship and other such things? I\\'ve met some morons say that they consider this to be the \"greatest movie ever made.\" Say WHAT?! Better than Star Wars? Better than The Godfather? Better than Casablanca? Better than Schindler\\'s List?! Get a grip, people- it\\'s a good movie, but you\\'re blowing it way out of proportion. What can be said about `Titanic\\' that hasn\\'t already been said? Seriously who hasn\\'t seen it? Well if your one of the few and you finally decided to take the uhmmÂ\\x85. Splash (pun intended) there are a few rules you need to remember. First, give yourself time for an intermission the film is quite long. Second, the film caters to all people. There is a love story for the pre-teen girls and for hopeful romantics (generally women) and for us guys there are some cool special effects in one of the most intense disaster films ever made. The final rule, sit back and enjoy.\\n\\nWorking with a `Titanic\\' budget James Cameron (director) put this gem together and created this intriguing story. Obviously the fate of the doomed ocean liner is true, but the fictitious love story is thrown in to attract more viewers. Warning there is a brief, but tastefully done nude scene and parental guidance is suggested. Also the illustrations of death and dying in the later parts of the film may be a bit too much for younger viewers. Now aside from that, I mean honestly, what more convincing do you need? The film earned over a billion dollars worldwide and scored a number of Oscars including best director and best picture. Filmmaking 101: Every well constructed screenplay should have three elements. A plot, a sub-plot and a sub-text. In the case of Titanic, about 95% of the viewers understood the plot. Perhaps as many understood the subplot, but perhaps 1 in a 1,000 really got the subtext which is the underpinnings of the film.\\n\\nThe plot: An unsinkable ship hits an iceberg and sinks with great loss of life. The subplot: a love story, which needed to be added to capture the teenage crowd, which, like it or not, is the prime audience of movie goers. In addition, without the subplot, all you have is a documentary, rather than a fine drama.\\n\\nThe subtext, however, may have been the most important part of the film. It\\'s about the classicism that existed in the early 20th century and to some extent is still around. Did you notice that life boats were available only to the first class passengers. Indeed those traveling steerage, mostly immigrants, were locked into their deck and doomed to a watery grave. If there\\'s a message inherent in Titanic, it isn\\'t that we should build better ships. We already do. With Global Positioning Satellites only the most negligent Captain would ever collide with an iceberg. It also isn\\'t about the immortality of love. Anybody who has loved and lost knows as much about that subject as any picture could ever convey.\\n\\nNo, the message is: we are all human beings and deserve to be treated equally, whether rich or poor, regardless of race or religion. That message is as fresh today as it was when the unsinkable ship plunged to its watery grave.\\n\\nPerhaps, the next time you see a good movie, you\\'ll think more about the sub-text and ask yourself what this film is really trying to say. The answer maybe worth more than the price of admission.\\n\\n8.5/10 I was skeptical when I first went to see the movie with my wife. I had heard it was a \"chick-flick\", and that the director had incorporated fictional characters into the real life drama. I was pleasantly surprised when I left the theatre. The movie delivered a compelling and factual account of the disaster, intertwined with the fictional main characters. Jack and Rose were important to the movie. They really told the story of so many of the actual Titanic victims who remain unknown to this day.\\n\\nClose to 1500 souls went down with the ship. The movie helped me to see their struggle to survive, and what were the shocking effects of hitting the iceberg. The tragedy at the World Trade Center certainly correlates with the Titanic disaster for modern times. This movie has piqued my interest so much that I viewed the Titanic exhibit when it came to Cleveland in 2002. nan great practical and special effects\\nwell acted\\ncan feel a bit sluggish or long at some points Cameron skillfully used the shipwreck of the \"century shipwreck\" Titanic as a traction, realism and romantic feelings complement each other, cleverly implanted romantic and Humanistic Love Tragedy, and created a magnificent film Titanic. In the context of the biggest shipwreck, the sad and beautiful love story is the main line of the movie, which is extremely provocative and tearful. The story starts with the search for \"the heart of the sea\", with the narration of Ruth, an old survivor of the shipwreck, as the introduction, and uses the flashback to introduce the audience into the mood of an involuntary role replacement. It\\'s wonderful to follow the characters. nan nan No way is this the greatest film of all time. Not by a long shot. To compare this to GONE WITH THE WIND and Leo and Kate\\'s performances to that of Viven Leigh and Clark Gable is ridiculous. Though Titanic IS good, it is no film of all time. Leo and Kate, though excellent in their performances are no Gable and Leigh, and though the film may be an epic, the ludicrous amount of Oscars slapped onto it (SO predictably) makes it less enjoyable because of the tons of hype lavished on it. Gone With The Wind was made at a time when films won Oscars for being GOOD. Today it depends on what film has the most budget and hype! Titanic: GWTW of the 90\\'s? I think not. James Camerson\\'s epic romance/disaster movie - a film that made big at the Box Office, but doesn\\'t do too much for me. I have seen the movie several times. It\\'s half and half (half romance - the other half disaster). What does make the movie set sail for me is the outstanding special effects - most worthy of an Oscar as well as the set design, sound, and costumes. The plot behind the disaster is rather more or less a soap opera type love affair between the two young lovers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). Somewhere during the love affair...I was reminded of the remake of King Kong (1976) - remember the love affair between Jessica Lange and the famous big gorilla? In James Cameron\\'s finest film to date, he writes and directs a period piece worthy of its name, and a solemn homage to those who passed on that fateful night in 1912. The labour of love\\'s only due comparison is to Hollywood\\'s yesteryear classics such as \"Gone With The Wind.\"\\n\\nWith a commentary on social classes and the trappings of the Victorians, Cameron goes beyond his norm -- and excells!!\\n\\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet charge the screen as Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukateer, respectfully. A strong supporting cast including \"The Invisible Man\"s Gloria Stuart, who carries the film in flashback, brillantly.\\n\\nIf you\\'re one of the very few people who haven\\'t seen it yet, be aware that you are missing one of Hollywood\\'s finest films. The combination of awestriking special effects and corsetted costume drama mix only too well. The tragedy here was the fact that they took what could have been a great film/story and turned it into a typical piece of Hollywood Crud! Seriously, the acting totally sucked! The screenplay was trite and boring. The contrived scenes with the old Rose (not to mention with all the other characters) were so sad, this piece of garbage could only come from small minds that merely used a bunch of special effects to mask the poorly written script! Sad, Sad, Sad......... I know that I\\'m certainly not in the majority on this one, obviously by the actual take on boxoffice and video rental/sales, but I know that I can tell good acting from affected, contrived, crud - and this certainly was full of the latter! Best Picture?!?!?!?! Honestly, the \"Academy\" bowed to box office sales and certainly not to their consciences on rewarding quality film making or acting.... Sad, Sad, Sad!!!!! nan I never cry at movies.\\n\\nI have only cried at 2 through my entire lifetime.\\n\\nWell, now it\\'s 3.\\n\\nI have been sobbing uncontrollably for about 10 minutes.\\n\\nGo figure.\\n\\n-Sasha nan This movie is my number one favorite of all time. The acting, production, music, story, special effects... I could just talk all day about everything that makes this movie amazing. I\\'ve seen it so many times that I know every line. I love Jack and Rose and their chemistry and how their lives intertwine and change each other\\'s. Just definitely a movie that can\\'t be topped! This Movie was stunning, and yes it did move me, but the fact that all these people are pretty much dead by now anyway, marred the whole tragidy part, so I liked the Special Effects. They really did catch the realizm of it all, and They Did pull the old heartstrings with the mother singing her Kids to sleep while a quartet played \"Nearer My God to Thee\", But I was in it for the intense Action: Miles of corridors filled with water, the Lights flickering out all at once, and the ship Breaking in half. that was cool There is certainly alot of biases about this movie. The chicks worship Leo so he delivered a terrible performance. Its one of the 10 biggest ticket sellers in history so it must be a terrible and unjustified success. And on the other side, everyone loves it and so I must, the Academy loved it and so it must be one of the greatest movies of all time. Leo really didn\\'t give alot to the movie but his presence did not detract, just the same as Kevin Costner in Dances With Wolves, he was just as wooden but for some strange reason he got nominated, he had about 1 and perhaps 2 different facial expressions but the movie soured as a masterpiece anyway. Titanic is one of the best theatre experiences, I never actually did see at the theatre but I saw twice on video, it is easy to imagine it, movies always are 100 times better on the big screen. Its becoming more and more rare now that people go with the crowd for the sake of it but occasionally we should try not to be so opinionated that we dont listen to anyone else. The Academy members were fresh out of the Theatres when the golden boy ballots arrived, the tactic is always a good one and had bearing here.\\n\\nBasically, James Cameron was 300 nautical miles from an original screenplay, and 882 feet from a historical tribute but the movie remains powerfull, a combination of the score, the vistas and general cinematography, the in your face presence of the movie and the usual \"dont let go\" love story stuff pulled it off very well, it had me rivetted and I wouldn\\'t mind one more viewing. Some of the blue screen shots are atroscious sure, and some of the digital effects leave me at a loss to understand why it won the award for them, Billy Zane and the supporting cast are all good, Winslet put in a good performance despite some of the previously mentioned laughable dialogue delivered to and by her. I reckon this movie holds interest alot better than many other epics, especially Gone With The Wind, Titanic needed its duration for the movies meaning and quality. I find it hard to believe that a ship crew would be riveted by some old ladies story about an in-cruise fling she had decades on decades ago, that was really corny.\\n\\nJust as a movie in my own opinion I\\'d give it 8.5, but by the constant cinema standards:\\n\\nProduction values: 2/2, Quality and Meaning 1.5/2, Acting 2/2, Screenplay 1.5, Originality .5/2\\n\\n7.5/10 nan Before I saw titanic I heard it was nominated for 10 plus academy awards. Also I heard rave reviews. So I figured it must be a great movie. It ended up being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It has little to nothing to do about the disaster, it\\'s just another episode of the love boat. So far, this is the most heavily user-reviewed movie I have encountered in IMDb. Here is yet another one (sorry)! During the summer of 1997, the studios ran grand coming attractions for \"Titanic,\" which capsulized the entire story and even showed in detail what would happen to Jack and Rose. It was tempting to think \"...why even see the movie? You already know what is going to happen!\" The movie absolutely cleaned up during the holiday season of 1997 and into the first few months of 1998. The theatrical experience of watching it on a big screen with stereo sound was beyond compare (my sister swears that the cinema in Cincinnati where she saw it cranked the air conditioning during the sinking scenes to give viewers an extra dimension to the frigid cold endured by all the passengers).\\n\\nOn the surface, the plot lines and basic story seem trite and contrived (poor boy meets rich girl). The fantastic acting by the leads and the direction of the massive cast of extras along with the superhuman attention to detail are what makes Titanic jump from the screen at the viewer.\\n\\nThink about the whole \"king of the world\" sequence with Jack and Fabrizio and the \"flying\" sequence with Jack and Rose. In the hands of a lesser director, both of these would have come across as self-aggrandizing pap, but the way both scenes is shot and Leo DeCaprio/Kate Winslet\\'s uncanny abilities and chemistry sent a shot of ecstasy throughout the whole theater. These scenes, along with several others, works well to capture the fabulous grandeur of the original Titanic.\\n\\nWhat is most often missed in reviews are the performances of actors in lesser roles, such as Billy Zane\\'s turn as an elegant cad, David Warner\\'s perfect casting as the classy \"thug\" bodyguard, Kathy Bates nailing her gauche, nouveau riche embodiment of the \"Unsinkable\" Molly Brown (she was a last minute casting), and scores of other astounding recreations from the captain to the top hatted billionaire and his eyes popping out when the water floods the stateroom.\\n\\nAccording to the trivia page, cinemas wore out their copies and needed replacements. People have probably also worn out their VHS, DVD and blue-ray copies. Nothing will wear out the enduring appeal of this classic as pure, full-on entertainment. nan nan Watching \\'Titanic\\' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let\\'s put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic\\'s fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor. So much for crying priorities!!\\n\\nI\\'m a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he\\'s tapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over (Titanic\\'s billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).\\n\\nSpecial effects were brilliant! But I\\'ll take the 1958 black and white \"A Night To Remember\" movie instead.\\n\\nToday\\'s lesson: If you\\'re going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains, don\\'t aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won\\'t see the spraying blood. This is life and death...better leave it to luck!\\n\\n7 out of 10 I managed to avoid watching this movie for years. I\\'m surprised that its rating here on IMDB is 7.0\\n\\nConsidering the rabid fan base, and the fact that you could NOT escape that horrid theme song for forever, I would have thought it was an awesome movie.\\n\\nWhen push comes to shove, it\\'s an OK movie, but it\\'s neither AWESOME nor TERRIBLE.\\n\\nIn short, it is a 7.0 movie, I guess.\\n\\nThe first half is the best, the second half falls apart completely. I guess it just goes to show that the more money you pour into a project, the more you can get out. This movie is perfect. The love story was believable, the acting was great, special effects were wonderful... This movie couldn\\'t be better!! This is only movie I\\'ve bought. I like to watch it again and again. Truly a masterpiece. nan I love Titanic it\\'s one of my favorites Rip Bill Paxton Rich girl falls in love with poor boy, much to the dismay of her mother and fiance. Hasn\\'t this been done before? Hasn\\'t it been done better? Hasn\\'t it been done with dialog that is above the 3rd grade level? The last hour was very exciting, but the first two were dull and predictable. \"Titanic\" is an average film at its best. But certainly it is the most overrated movie in history.\\n\\nOK, the visuals were great, and the last hour was exciting. But the first two hours were nothing more than a routine, predictable love story that has been done over and over again. Were you able to tell which characters would live and which would die the moment you first saw them enter the story? If not, then you\\'ve only seen two or three movies in your entire life!\\n\\nAnd that dialog! Ugg!\\n\\nGet to the theater late for this one. Catch the last hour only. I must admit it. This film deserves all it\\'s awards. The film did have great cinematography, great editing, good shot selection, and outstanding special effects. I liked Kate Winslet\\'s performance and the art production team deserves a special award for innovation alone.\\n\\nBut the film sunk on screenplay and character development. Fortunately all the award organizations, mainly the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, didn\\'t recognize the film for it\\'s screenplay. In fact, the film didn\\'t even receive a nomination of screenplay. But all the other eleven awards given to the film, including best picture of the year, was well deserved. I give the film a \"B+\" and an 8 out of 10. I must be the only person on Earth who hated this movie. It was long and boring. If you can stand sitting for 3 and a half hours just watching Leonardo Dicaprio complain because he\\'s in love with a girl thats too classy for him, then this is the movie for you. The only reason this made so much money was because of that Dicaprio guy and not the fact it was a good movie. If you want to see a good movie that involves a ship sinking at the end, watch Jaws. At least that had excitement. I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen > i love this movie. this movie was one my favorites along with many other friends of mine. we would watch it over and over. hehe. i have always liked leonardo dicaprio. he is a great actor and has great looks. he plays handsome jack dawson, a poor artistic american who travels all around the world. he wins his ticket on titanic at a lucky game of poker along with his italian friend fabrizo. he seems to care very much about people and their feelings. despite all of cal\\'s money and power, he could never measure up to someone like jack dawson. the prideful cal realizes his competition with jack even in the beginning. he thinks how could someone as wealthy and powerful as him lose a woman\\'s heart to a 3rd class passenge? the answer is love. he meets the beautiful rose, a 1st class passenger about to be wed to the wealthy but evil cal hockley. it was an arranged marriage made by rose\\'s money hungry mother who doesn\\'t ever seem to consider what rose wants or how she feels. her mother and fiancee seem to have absolute control over her. this pushes her even closer to the edge. the two meet out of fate. jack reaches out to rose and he ends up falling in love with her. as does rose. rose is left with the decision as whether she should stay loyal to the evil cal and her mother. people seem to complain that this movie has way to much romance and not enough action. it has plenty of action. a movie like this can really open up your emotions. i don\\'t see anything wrong with adding a little romance. some of the characters are ficticous obviously but it still includes history on famous passengers; thomas andrews, bruce ismay, margaret \"molly\" brown or the \"unsinkable\" molly brown, john jacob astor, captain e.j. smith, 1st officer merdock and many others. obviously they\\'re all 1st class passengers merely famous for their money. a lot of the movie centres around 1st class and 3rd class. i didn\\'t see anything on 2nd class though. to this day the movie still makes me cry. it would be nice if all men were like jack dawson and no men like cal hockley. hehe. well if you like romances/thrillers and want a good cry i reccomend titanic to you. 10 stars out of 10! hats of to james cameron! Adventurers delve to the bottom of the ocean to search the ghostly remains of the Titanic. It\\'s a very haunting moment because it still rests at the bottom of the ocean this day. They find a safe with a drawing of a young woman wearing a ruby known as \\'The Heart of the Ocean\\'. They get a call from a 100 year old lady claiming the drawing is her.\\n\\nThere is great chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio who both give great performances. It\\'s a groundbreaking achievement from the gorgeous cinematography, sound effects and editing. It\\'s a very immersive experience as there is so much attention to detail with the incredible set designs, costume designs and makeup giving it a very authentic look. James Horners sweeping music score is heartfelt and intense.\\n\\nJames Cameron is a magnificent director who before this made action sci-fi blockbusters like the Terminator films and The Abyss. He proves that he is very versatile filmmaker who can make more than just action films. Its no surprise the film won 11 Oscars and became the highest grossing film ever made. nan The score for this film, and the soaring musical sequences while the leads are on the bow of the ship at dusk before the sinking will go down in history as one of the most unforgettable moments of movie making genius. Rent or buy the video if you haven\\'t already! The first thing I\\'ll say about this movie is that it was excellent and will long be remembered as a classic for this generation. The casting was excellent with the possible exception of Leonardo DeCaprio - somehow he just seemed a bit young for the part. Chris O\\'Donnell or Josh Lucas would\\'ve been a bit closer to the mark here. As far as the Rose character, wonderfully portrayed by Kate Winslet, it didn\\'t take a lot of time to see the possible real person she was based on. Her mannerisms and defiance of custom seemed to emulate the late Alice Roosevelt Longworth (1884-1980), daughter of Theodore Roosevelt. As I watched Kate, I began to see Alice, literally! If you don\\'t know much about Alice and her later impact on Washington DC politics and mores, there are several great bios available. I would recommend this film to anyone over 13, parents should watch out of the eyes of the little ones. Excellent film! Anyone who has even a glimmer of an idea of language, thought, or customs of turn-of-the-century US/Britain would be repelled by this film. I\\'ve read a number of survivor accounts, and people just didn\\'t THINK or TALK the way they thought and spoke in the film. Anachronisms aside, it was, I suppose, only a love story. But there are so many better ones that have been filmed. Titanic was to me a real disappointment. A glorified sit-com, or soap opera. This is one big hustle; I\\'m told it\\'s the best movie ever...I must be from Mars. It\\'s an insult to 1500 who died in 1912, an insult to women, and a patronizing film in 1998. Well, I\\'m a Star Wars fan so naturally I\\'m going to hate Titanic. Yep, I gave it a 1 out of 10. All I have to say is rerelease Titanic in theaters for it\\'s 20th anniversary and we\\'ll see if can make $130+ million dollars in that run alone, like the Star Wars Special Edition did. That will/will not have a lot to say about the long-term value of this \"epic\". On first viewing, I loved Titanic against my desire. It had one of the\\n\\nmost beautiful musical scores I\\'d heard, so haunting and captivating it\\n\\nmade my heart sink in a dizzy flutter of melancholic wonder. I\\'d\\n\\npreviously loathed Celine Dion\\'s music and despised her milking of\\n\\nemotion - but \"My Heart Will Go On\" broke down my resistance via this\\n\\nfilm and its instrumental scoring therein. One of my guiltiest pleasures\\n\\nremains this film which many of my alternative instincts demanded I hate\\n\\non principle. (ie \"10 or more smaller films could have been made for the\\n\\ncost\" etc) I saw Titanic several times at the cinema but avoided seeing it on video\\n\\n\\n\\nLast night - nearly four years later - I watched it on television\\n\\nnervously. But revisiting Titanic in this way didn\\'t destroy the majesty\\n\\nbut brought a sense of renewal. The film retains a magical romantic\\n\\nquality that becomes most apparent in its moments of silence as the\\n\\nTitanic sails over the water and the characters exchange wordless\\n\\nglances while that wonderfully melancholic and dreamy score drifts round\\n\\nthe mind. I was also afraid the external issues which came to shadow\\n\\nover the film (the Oscar stuff, the cost, the negativity, star ego,\\n\\nover-exposure and so on) would impact on my experience along with age\\n\\nand changes in my life. Yet, none of these issues took hold. The film is\\n\\nstill arresting, sweet, powerful and convincing. Small moments and\\n\\ncertain shots remain classic touches and trademark the film as a\\n\\nmemorable movie. The plot involving love against the odds and a struggle between social\\n\\ndistinctions/classes is hardly the simple cliche that many critical\\n\\napproaches to the film emphasise. Its a daily, everday experience that\\n\\nthe film raises to epic, grand levels - as film inevitably always does\\n\\nby its very nature. The story of two strangers who - through luck on\\n\\nJack\\'s part, and failed social engineering on the part of Rose\\'s mother\\n\\n\\n\\nsubverting the order of things in the name of love - and finding that\\n\\nlove changed forever by the tragic sinking of Titanic - resonates with a\\n\\ngrandeur that is never arch or distant. The film always trusts the\\n\\nyouthful, idealistic exuberance of love and the rest of the events pale\\n\\ninto the background. If the script is anything it is a submissive crutch\\n\\nto the passion which drives the film. If there is a common,\\n\\nunsophisticated touch to it maybe that shouldn\\'t be so quickly dismissed\\n\\nor treated with such negative ire - common after all also means widely\\n\\ncirculated and available to more than a privileged few. The performances grow more interesting as time flows on. DiCaprio\\'s\\n\\nsmarm becomes more and more of a charm as Winslet\\'s reserve feels more\\n\\nand more a crumbling cage for her passion. As a couple, they offer a\\n\\nyouthful charge never more apparent than in the scenes in the\\n\\nlower-class quarters below as their romance takes a furious hold. And\\n\\nthe framing story is a nice adjunct as the adventurers and divers are\\n\\nenthralled by the older Rose\\'s heartbreaking tale of love, loss, and the\\n\\nmagic of memory. As a depiction of oral storytelling, it makes one long\\n\\nfor the intimacy of such a situation and cherish the deeper, felt\\n\\ncommunication between friends, lovers and sometimes - maybe most\\n\\nmagically of all - strangers. Characters like Jack and Rose remind us of the romantic dreaminess of\\n\\nbeing young and growing, learning and experiencing. Which remains a\\n\\ngreat antidote to the cynicism and callousness of many other popular\\n\\nfilms. Long live diversity and unexpected treasures like Titanic. When I first seen this movie I loved it from beginning to end. I mean it was simply beautiful. The effects were amazing, the acting was great, and the story was excellent. So I don\\'t see why so many people hate this movie. It racked up 11 Oscars for a reason. A lot of people do not like the love story put into this tragic event almost a century ago. Hello people without the love story it would just be another documentary in this tragic event. I thought the story played perfect in with a movie of this caliber. It also had comic relief from what it was about to lead up to from Molly Brown(Kathy Bates). Also the great stories by the ever so hated Jack who was played perfectly by Leonardo DiCaprio who has become a icon playing parts such as The Aviator and The Departed. Also we cannot forget about Rose DeWitt Bukater his love played by Kate Winslet. These to had perfect chemistry throughout the entire movie and made it as sad as it was to become. I think the love story and all around them brought this story more into vision to people about how sad that tragic day really was.\\n\\nIn this movie there were also great special effects supplied by Robert Legato, Mark A. Lasoff, Thomas L. Fisher Michael Kanfer who won the Academy Awards for best special effects, and did they deserve it. From the beginning where the boat was at the dock under the sun, or when it road freely through the night or even the sad climatic sinking of the ship, it was all put together so great. The cinematography in this movie was also greatly produced by Russell Carpenter who gathered in Academy Award for cinematography. We cant forget about Gloria Stuart who played the older Rose perfectly and told the story as if there were no flaws as if we couldn\\'t help but believe the love between her and Jack that was tragically ended. This movie deserved every Award it won from music which was great to best sound to best art which was extremely excellent in this movie.\\n\\nI think James Cameron deserves every award he won for putting together this masterpiece in a simply magnificent form. He took a tragic event and put it into so many peoples minds for the rest of there lives. He was even able to include a protagonist and antagonist in an event like this. I don\\'t know how you could not like this movie. In the effects and acting column it has Peter Jackson proportions. Every scene is beautiful and amazing. If you have never seen this movie don\\'t judge it and just bye it. I recommend this movie for anyone who is up for an amazing performance and a great love story. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. The storyline was brilliant and enjoyable with brilliant directing. The film made you care about the characters and their death. The audience knew the ship was going to sink, but leading up to the ship sinking made you care about the people and crew. This film was about building on the characters. Kate Winslet stole the film.\\n\\nHowever, Leonardo with Kate Winslet made this film unbelievable and annoying. It\\'s hard to imagine Kate with the homeless and unattractive Leonardo. Kate definitely deserved to be recognized for her performance and Leonardo should have never been mentioned. In reality Kate\\'s character would have never been with the unattractive and homeless Leonardo over Billy\\'s character of a millionaire. Billy is so much more attractive and successful than Leonardo who is such a boy.\\n\\nLeonardo was a cry baby when he wasn\\'t nominated for an Oscar and Kate was. Kate gave a remarkable performance and nothing stood out with Leonardo. nan Sorry to pour cold water (if you\\'ll forgive the fun) on this Oscar winning tribute to the programmers art, but this film is too long, too wooden and captures the atmosphere of Edwardian England to the same degree as Dick Van Dyke mimics our accent. I have no doubt that the special effects are very clever and took people an awful lot of hours and megabytes...but where do they take us? A computer generated ship with generated seagulls looks exactly that. The sets are spectacular yet manage to scream out that they are expensive sets rather than that they are the inside of a living working ship. And don\\'t get me started on the levels of my indifference towards the talentless Mr.DiCaprio who bestrides the film in the same way as most children do when stumbling into a grown-ups party. Watch A Night To Remember if you want to feel the real emotion of the Titanic\\'s sinking and watch this if you want to spend three hours seeing Mr.Cameron trying to show us how clever he is...and failing. Hold on a moment, Roger Ebert and everyone else who gave this movie a high rating. The Titanic sank in 1912 with a large death toll, and over 1500 stories of bravery, cowardice, selfishness, regret, horror, nobility, and so on. Titanic is a movie about the event and, unfortunately, only a triumph for the special effects people. The script is trite, making cheap melodrama of tragedy. To see the spectacular sinking, you only need to view the last half hour or so. Just pretend that jack and rose are lesbians and the whole movie is 10x improved- a radical watching experience. even if you don\\'t, this movie is genuinely so enjoyable and interesting. i would consider it simultaneously under- and overhyped. i can\\'t actually think of a flaw Pros: Directing, Special effects, Score, Kate winslet Cons: Turns to melodrama at the end\\n\\nNot the best film of that year(LA Confidential takes that title) but the best epic of the 90\\'s. James Cameron\\'s 200 million dollar tale is both epic in size and intimate and Cameron provides wonderful directing and pacing for the film. Often named the most popular film in history, it broke box office records held by jurassic park due in part to the leading man Leonardo di Caprio. Cameron\\'s film starts out slow but once the ship hits the iceberg, it\\'s nonstop action till the end. Kate winslet character seems a bit spoilt and billy zane is unbelievable but these are minor quibbles to an otherwise terrific film\\n\\nPremise: Film details the fate of several passengers in the maiden and only voyage of the titanic.\\n\\nTitanic was nominated for fourteen academy awards and won 11. Tied with Ben-Hur as the most in history.\\n\\nGrade: 9.5/10 (Breathtaking epic) This is the movie with EVERYTHING. If you have not seen this movie, you\\'re missing out on a unique experience. What I liked best about this movie is that every time I watch it I feel like I\\'m there with the characters, and that those characters are real people (some actually were).\\n\\nThis movie does have one flaw. There are points in the movie where the dialogue becomes rather corny. However, this can also work to the film\\'s advantage to make you believe that it is taking place in a more naive time. Wow. It only took me one viewing to decide on making this my favorite movie. Kate Winslet gave a fabulous oscar-worthy performance as young Rose, and Leo was really good as Jack Dawson. Even though this movie is over three hours long, the viewer will get so wrapped up in the intensity of the film they won\\'t even realize the length. Go see it! This film is underrated and yet so beautiful! In 1997, the world was introduced to a heartbreaking, uplifting film which provides you 3 hours and 20 minutes or so with romance, adventure, danger, the spirit of kindness, offering the person you love your own life (just like Jack Dawson did for Rose). I ask you - what more can a movie give you? Tell me that! Even the scenes like when Rose takes off her clothes and Jack draws her naked, and the moderate/strong bad language which comes in frequently doesn\\'t put me off. I think the certificate should\\'ve been 15+. I personally do not think the mature sequences in this movie are suitable for a big kid aged 12. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are the our stars in this outstanding epic. Their characters are far from similar because Rose is rich and she mixes with snobby people and yet she doesn\\'t like them at all and she\\'s also feisty. Jack is poor and likes to hang out with his mates and despite his rough edges, he has a heart of gold! He is such a loving, selfless young man who even took his own life. Anyway, when Rose can\\'t put up with being somebody she doesn\\'t want, she bolts out of Titanic\\'s main restaurant and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the ship. Jack sees what she\\'s doing and insists that she doesn\\'t drop off the railing. At first she tells him to goaway, but he holds out his hand and she gives him her hand. She slips and nearly falls into the sea. He uses all his strength to lift her back onto the boat. From then, they gradually fall in love with each other. This feature-film makes me cry big tears every time I see it. I sob in the same way a person would do if they were mourning the death of a loved one. I feel as if I may not stop crying for at least an hour after the film finishes. Even some of the scenes that aren\\'t sad make me cry. Like; when Jack feels upset when Rose tries to avoid him because she\\'s engaged to Cal Hockley (a heartless and violent man) just to please him but the evening of the day when she tells him not to keep seeing her she has a sudden change of mind and comes to see him at the front of \"Titanic\". He reaches for her hand and tells her to step up onto the railing, let her arms spread out while he supports her and then she believes she\\'s flying and at that point they kiss. It\\'s shot beautifully against evening pink skies - it\\'s just so tearful, knowing this couple are sharing their final evening together and- (Sniffles). Rose says to Jack \"Jack when the ship docks, I\\'m getting off with you!\", sadly, what I say is \"you mean IF the ship docks!\" and from there all the tragedy of Titanic\\'s collision into the iceberg will come in in only a short matter of time. When it happens Jack is held prisoner right at the bottom of the ship and they leave him there even when the ship is sinking! Luckily, Rose comes to his rescue and releases him. Then, as Rose is rich and Jack is poor, Rose is forced to board a boat and as it lowers he hand which is holding Jack\\'s is pulled away. Cal Hockley menacingly says to Jack as she leaves, \"I always win, Jack\" - uh, not this time buster! But she leaps off the lifeboat and runs to his arms. He runs to her, too, and that\\'s also too emotional to be true. But there\\'s more tragedy to come. When the entire ship sinks to the bottom, after \"the ship\\'s arse snaps\" as that man said at the beginning, Jack and Rose spot a board afloat but it\\'s too small for them BOTH, so very selflessly, Jack lifts her onto the board and he stays in the freezing water. \"You have got to promise me that you\\'ll survive, that you\\'ll make babies and watch them grow. Promise me, Rose, that you\\'ll die a little old lady warm in her bed. But not here, not this night! That divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me it brought me to you. Please, make me that promise.\" He kisses her hand for the last time. Rose later tells Jack there\\'s a boat to save them - but he doesn\\'t answer or even move. He has frozen to death. Rose cannot believe it but bravely lets him sink; now I know I\\'ll cry! WHAT A SAD MOVIE!!! But, despite its trauma, \"Titanic\" is irresistible. Over 15s won\\'t be able to help but succumb to its beauty. Far better than the offensive \"Gone with the Wind\". Rose may be feisty but she\\'s certainly not a self-obsessed harpy like Scarlett O\\'Hara and Jack Dawson is anything but that arrogant cad Rhett Butler, the womanising scumbag! Titanic is VERY underrated and \"Gone With The Wind\" is VERY overrated - absurd but, cest la vie!\\n\\nGloria Stuart was 86 when she starred as old Rose and with this film she is most associated. Her final film was \"Lands of Plenty\" in 2004. The following year, she contracted cancer but had always appeared well to the public eye. She also looked frail in her old age. James Cameron attended her 100th birthday. For a moment I thought she\\'d live forever! I am deeply saddened to report that Gloria Stuart died of cancer last Sunday. She was 100 years old. God love her! I showed my mother a beautiful tribute to her on Youtube and she revealed that she could feel Gloria\\'s energy around me, she felt her there. Apparently she put her arm round me then blew me a kiss goodbye.\\n\\nA divine and inspirational woman...\\n\\nGLORIA STUART\\n\\n4th July 1910-26th September 2010 I have set it upon myself to write this review to tell the trough about Titanic. To expose its number one weakness so that it no longer be confused with any others. Why do so many hate this movie and are ready to swear that it is one of the worst ever made? Perhaps they should expose their eyes to everyday movies more often if they speak thus. Let us examine the movie. The acting, while not all that brilliant, is sufficient for the parts to come through honestly enough. The dialogue, while not the greatest or deepest is appropriate and, let\\'s face it, in view of what comes out now a days, quite descent. The length of the movie may be long but is, I feel, necessary and the movie does hold attention with ought becoming a bore. The special effects are, no one can dispute, magnificent, and the costumes realistic. So what is so incredibly bad about this movie? It is alright. It is, in fact, better then alright. It is a rather darn good movie about love with a historical background. The biggest weakness of this movie is that rather then being viewed as pretty dang good, it was rather viewed as the best thing ever created by man or god. As history shows when something is overrated a lot of people start to boo it for being unworthy, and thus call it total crap. nan Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, and superbly directed by James Cameron, is truly a beautiful story. The Film tells the story of the Titanic from a different perspective. Leonardo Plays Jack, as poor young man who just managed to get onto the Titanic, and Kate Winslet plays Rose, a rich young lady, whom with Jack does she fall in love DiCaprios acting is fantastic, same goes for Winslet.\\n\\nA lot of people complain about their acting, saying it\\'s cheesy and cheap. Well I have one thing to say to those people, and that is that the acting is Supposed to be cheesy. It\\'s a Melodrama, and it\\'s not trying to win Oscars for Acting.\\n\\nBetween the Spectacular Special Effects and the Tearjerking score, Titanic will surely leave no dry eye in the house. A Classic will live on. When I first read Walter Lord\\'s magnificent \"A Night To Remember\" in 1978 at the age of 9, I began a love affair with the story of the Titanic and her people that continues to this day, and it is partly responsible for my being a professional historian today. It is because of that, that there have been few nights as disappointing to me as the one and only time I saw this movie.\\n\\nYes, the technical details are brilliant, but the bottom line for any movie must be its story and characters and the manner in which James Cameron exploited the tragedy of the Titanic to tell a cheap, third-rate story of horny teenage lust that is far worse than the tawdry soap opera of the 1996 CBS miniseries \"Titanic\" continues to offend me to this day.\\n\\nIt is not the fact that James Cameron told a fictional story at the expense of compelling real history like the Californian incident that offends me so much, it\\'s the fact that this is a *bad* fictional story. No one aboard the real Titanic had a situation remotely resembling the one of Jack and Rose. Why couldn\\'t Cameron have told a fictional story revolving around something real and representative of what was on the Titanic? If he wanted to do a class barrier romance, then why not have Jack be an honest Irish immigrant out to make a fortune in America (as so many of Titanic\\'s steerage were) instead of some loser-drifter in life who couldn\\'t make an honest living in the real world beyond Titanic? (Jack strikes me as the working class Gaylord Ravenal. Someone who in ten years is going to be just as bad as Cal is) Or better still, why not a story of a young newlywed couple that was parted by the tragedy? God knows there were plenty of those couples aboard Titanic, but I guess in this day and age of Hollywood morals, \"true love\" can not exist between a married couple, thus rendering that idea politically incorrect in James Cameron\\'s eyes. And so we get the false dichotomy in which a person\\'s capacity to love is measured by his poverty, a message that is not only stupid in and of itself but also false to the reality of what was on Titanic (one need only point to the true love that existed between the Strauses, who perhaps not coincidentally had all their key scenes left on the cutting room floor).\\n\\nThere is so much more I could rant about (the demeaning depictions of First Officer Murdoch and Molly Brown also come to mind), but the bottom line is that as a Titanic enthusiast I feel disgusted that James Cameron has hijacked any hope that one day someone could make a movie about the Titanic with modern technology that did justice to her, just as \"A Night To Remember\" so brilliantly did in 1958. For me, \"A Night To Remember\" and the 1979 TV-movie \"SOS Titanic\" remain the definitive Titanic movies and should be seen as antidotes to this horrid mess. If you like really, really bad acting, then this enormously boring film is just the film for you! The plot is tedious and obvious. The film technique makes it difficult to tell what the special effects are - this is achieved by making everything look as if it is a badly executed special effect. You could cut two and a half hours from this film and, though it still wouldn\\'t be any good, it would be a lot less bad. One of the best movies ever made!.... and also a movie people ONLY would put down because of the attention it got.... \\'Titanic\\' is absolutly flawless... never boring... and has a story to die for... A powerhouse with the Oscars, only true lose (besides Kate) was Gloria Stuart being practically robbed of a VERY worthy her Best Suporting Actress Oscar.... Everything Is to like about this film from the Song (one which we all know) to the Actors, and lets not forget the special effects... they just dont get any better than that.... lets face it hardly any film gets better than this... except \\'Gone With The Wind of coarse... :) I saw a dismal film ahead, when I first saw the opening credits, but it was still entertaining, and a little tragic. In the typical James Cameron style, this film is just crawling with stuff you wouldn\\'t believe. The movie starts out dull, with Gloria Stuart helping to pad out the first ten minutes, but then it really gets rolling! Afterwards, I had to ask myself: Hey, got a cigarette? I felt spent, and that\\'s typical of Cameron movies too. If Cameron made a biblical film, I bet he\\'d have a twenty minute crucifixion scene. The sinking was incredible, and they saved the best for last; the rest is just another day on board a Loveboat style rip-off. Oh well, Cameron\\'s not much without his special effects here, but that\\'s what everyone who goes to see this movie already knows. James Cameron should stop giving himself Orson Welles injections, and just stick to making action movies. I just keep thinking of those slick effects in his other films, and how beautiful they all were. This movie? I guess James was just trying to display some emotion, but it was corny. The sinking is what this movie\\'s about. Rating: 7/10 (Bill Paxton must have been depressed about his part in the movie)'"
